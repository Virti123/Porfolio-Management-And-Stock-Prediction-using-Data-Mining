'Banks crash; Nomura says base rate cut likely to hit NIM \r\nMost banks till date have cut base rates by around 25-30 basis points and after this cut by HDFC Bank, their base rates are around 35-65 bps higher than HDFC Bank – such a large differential is difficult to sustain beyond 1-2 months, feels Nomura. \r\n\r\nThe recent base rate cuts are likely to have an impact on net interest margin of banks in near-to-medium term but that is credit-positive in long run, says Nomura. HDFC Bank   on Monday announced a big 35-basis point cut in its base rate to 9.35 percent from 9.7 percent (taking a cumulative base rate cut of 65 basis points from January 2015), the lowest in industry. It is the third rate cut by the bank. The country\'s second largest private sector lender cut base rate by 15 bps on June 17 and by 15 bps on April 7. Canara Bank also cut base rate by 10 basis points to 9.9 percent on Monday. Most banks till date have cut base rates by around 25-30 basis points and after this cut by HDFC Bank, their base rates are around 35-65 bps higher than HDFC Bank – such a large differential is difficult to sustain beyond 1-2 months, feels Nomura.

According to the brokerage, banks in the interim will have to take some hit on NIMs if they intend to match the base rate cut of HDFC Bank.

Morgan Stanley is underweight on all public sector banks except Bank of Baroda   and says this is an opportunity to sell. The brokerage sees a 30 percent downside as it thinks other PSU banks (except BoB) face sustained low profitability and weak balance sheets. Morgan Stanley warns that commodity price declines will hurt asset quality materially as PSU banks have fairly high exposure to this area and hence earnings per share (EPS) revisions may continue to be downward and stocks should remain weak. Unimpressed by Indradhanush, government\'s seven-pronged strategy for bank\'s survival, Morgan Stanley thinks it is not enough for the banks to make proper provisions and start growing. \"Until then, they will likely keep pushing non-performing loans (NPLs) into the future, provisions will bleed in, and multiples will keep de-rating given a lack of investor trust in balance sheets, in our view,\" it says in a note. The government has assured capital infusion of Rs 20,088 crore into 13 PSU banks within a month\'s time with country\'s largest lender SBI cornering a hefty Rs 5,531 crore. The brokerage also is concerned that pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) margin, which is already close to credit costs, could decline materially, implying potential losses for some banks. Meanwhile, SBI remains to be Morgan Stanley’s least-favoured large cap stock as it ROE for SBI will be 12-13 percent even once credit costs normalise, which is likely In 2-3 years away.

'Indian drugmakers expect a slowdown in new generic drug approvals by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to weigh on sales in their largest market for at least two more quarters, due to an ongoing overhaul of the review process. India\'s USD 15 billion pharmaceutical industry, which has been hit by a spate of regulatory sanctions in the past year due to concerns about production processes, supplies about 40 percent of generic and over-the-counter drugs to the United States. The FDA implemented the Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA) programme in October 2012, giving the agency the right to collect fees from manufacturers to expedite the approval for sale of generic drugs. But the agency has not made as much progress with clearing the existing backlog of applications for cheap copycat drugs as some Indian manufacturers had hoped, company executives said, which is now beginning to drag on sales in the United States. A rise in the number of filings for new generic drugs from India and elsewhere, and the need to step up inspections of production facilities before giving final approval, is putting pressure on FDA resources, adding to the backlog, analysts said. While the FDA is hiring more staff and looking to speed up the process, Indian pharmaceutical industry executives say the pace of approvals is unlikely to pick up until 2016.

Consolidated revenue grew by 8.3 percent to Rs 2,720 crore in the quarter ended June 2014 from Rs 2,511 crore in same quarter last year. \"Domestic sales grew 17 percent to Rs 1289 crore led by growth in respiratory, anti-infective and cardiac therapies while exports of formulations rose by 12.7 percent to Rs 1218 crore during the quarter primarily due to growth in anti-retroviral, anti-asthma and anti-allergic segments.

Revenue may increase by 23 percent to Rs 2830.4 crore in the quarter ended June 2014 from Rs 2,308 crore in corresponding quarter of last fiscal. Operating profit is expected to rise 3.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 530.4 crore but margin may decline 350 basis points to 18.7 percent in the quarter gone by. There may be some recovery in margin on sequential basis, say analysts; in Q4FY14, margin contracted to 15.7 percent with operating profit falling 12.5 percent Y-o-Y. Analysts expect margin pressure on yearly basis due to low margin anti-retroviral (ARV) sales in Medpro and change in export strategy by creating own front-end and filing own intellectual properties (hence increased R&D costs). Analysts say revenue growth may benefit from incorporation of Medpro (which contributes 25 percent to total sales) in Q2FY14 but may be impacted due to high base effect of domestic formulations and milestone payment on Dymista in the US (other income of Rs 180 crore in Q1FY14). Overall export formulation growth is expected to be above 20 percent Y-o-Y due to overall higher capacity utilisation in Indore SEZ and currency.

'In a setback to Cipla   , the Delhi High Court today held that the Indian drug major was infringing Swiss pharmaceutical company Hoffman-La Roche\'s patent in lung cancer drug erlotinib hydrochloride, sold under the name of Tarceva. A bench of justices Pradeep Nandrajog and Mukta Gupta arrived at the conclusion by noting that Cipla\'s lung cancer medicine, Erlocip, was one polymorphic form of the erlotinib hydrochloride compound, which may exist in several forms, and Roche\'s patent claim was not limited to any one such version. \"This (the patent) is a sufficiently broad claim that is clearly not limited to any polymorphic version of erlotinib hydrochloride, but to erlotinib hydrochloride itself. This compound may exist in several polymorphic forms, but any and all such forms will be subsumed within this patent. Therefore as Cipla s Erlocip is admittedly one particular polymorphic form of the erlotinib hydrochloride compound (polymorph B), it will clearly infringe the IN 774 patent (of Roche). \"We thus conclude this issue by noting that the single judge\'s finding that \'Tarceva\' and \'Erlocip\' were based on the polymorph B version of erlotinib hydrochloride, though correct factually, is irrelevant to the subject matter of the present patent as Cipla has clearly infringed Claim 1 of Roche\'s IN 774 patent in arriving at the said polymorph,\" the bench said. It, however, did not grant any injunction in favour of Roche by restraining Cipla, saying the patent in favour of the Swiss company would expire in March 2016 and no such order had been passed by the single-judge and the Indian company had continued to manufacture and sell Erlocip. \"We decree that Cipla would be liable to render accounts concerning manufacture and sale of Erlocip, for which purpose suit filed by Roche against Cipla is restored with direction that it be listed before the joint registrar who would record evidence pertaining to the profits made by Cipla concerning the offending product. \"Thereafter the report of the joint registrar shall be placed before the single judge as per roster for appropriate orders,\" the bench also said while imposing costs of Rs five lakh on the Indian company. The court in its 106-page judgment also said that as Cipla \"could not establish prima facie that suit patent was obvious\" therefore, its plea for invalidating Roche\'s patent on the ground of \'obviousness\', \"fails\".\r\n\r\n',neg
'In Cipla   this is more of a technical correction that we are expecting more on the basis of the way the open interest has been added up. Plus the delivery volumes, the way they have picked up and the stock has breached, I think one of the very crucial supports, Rs 625-630 zone.\" \"So, if one can keep a stoploss of Rs 635, Rs 585-590, that is the zone which is the next very strong support of Cipla where it can revisit. It is one of the pharmaceutical stocks which is going extremely weak now. So, I think traders can make some more money on the downside here\r\n\r\n',neg
'\"One can continue to hold Cipla   and would like to hold on and probably I think buy at lows. Fundamental view point out here is very simple.

The stock, at the start of last week had given a breakout from a triangle pattern.

Telecom sector too has been mired with problems, so it is not one of his favourites. According to him, stocks within sectors are giving divergent performances, so it is becoming more of a stock specific and increasingly bottom-up market.

Going ahead we expect HMCL to increase the prices by Rs 1000/unit in FY15 which will result in higher EBITDA margin.

Sales are expected to decrease by 15.5 percent Q-o-Q (down 3.7 percent Y-o-Y) to Rs 49959.9 crore, according to Motilal Oswal. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) are likely to rise by 2 percent Q-o-Q (down 47.1 percent Y-o-Y) to Rs 536.2 crore. Motilal Oswal on HPCL: Quarterly profitability of the OMC\'s (BPCL, HPCL, and IOC) has remained dependent on the subsidy sharing, which is ad-hoc, than on business fundamentals. For 2QFY15, we model upstream sharing at 60 percent, government’s sharing at 30 percent and the rest 10 percent sharing by the OMC\'s. The final picture will only be clear when the govt. finalises the subsidy sharing for 2QFY15. For FY15, we model marginal sharing by OMC\'s (2 percent /INR16b), with the rest being shared by upstream (60 percent / INR494b) and the government (38 percent / INR313b). For FY16 / FY17 we model OMC\'s share at 2 percent, with the rest being shared by upstream and the government. 2QFY15 gross under-recoveries have declined by 29 percent Q-o-Q due to lower under recoveries led by price hikes in diesel, and lower international prices of crude and petroleum products. We peg refinery throughput at 4.5mmt for 2QFY15 (v/s 3.3mmt in 1QFY15 and 3.9mmt in 2QFY14). We expect HPCL to report PAT of INR540m in 2QFY15, v/s INR3.2b in 2QFY14 and INR460m in 1QFY15.

Net sales are seen going up by 9 percent to Rs 57,250 crore in the second quarter of current financial year 2014-15 from Rs 52,525 crore in corresponding quarter of last fiscal driven by higher sales volume and nil under recovery. Operating profit may fall 45 percent year-on-year to Rs 920 crore and margin may decline 160 basis points to 1.6 percent in the quarter gone by. Factors to watch Gross refining margin (GRM) is expected to decline year-on-year due to decrease in global margins and inventory loss on account of fall in Brent crude prices. Average GRMs are expected to be at USD 2.4 a barrel during the quarter as against USD 3.8 a barrel in previous quarter. Brent crude price averaged around USD 102 a barrel, down 9 percent Y-o-Y in rupee terms and down 7 percent in dollar terms.

'Recently, under-recoveries reduced to near zero, thanks to the January 2013 decision to hike prices by 50 paise a month till they reached market levels. Analysts expect the government to deregulate diesel prices soon. The reduced under-recoveries would help both upstream and downstream oil companies. In a note, Motilal Oswal wrote that ongoing diesel reforms have the potential to reverse the upstream (ONGC) subsidy trend from 70-40 (subsidy-net realization) to 40-70 i.e. subsidy will reduce from USD70 per barrel to USD 40 per barrel while net realization would increase from USD40 per barrel to USD70 per barrel. This could result in earnings to grow a compounded 20 percent over the next three years. While for OMCs, interest cost as a percentage of sales had increased from lows of 0.1 percent in FY04 to about 1.2 percent led by funding for diesel under-recoveries, analysts at the brokerage firm wrote. “During the last 12 months, diesel under-recoveries have come down significantly leading to meaningful reduction in the OMC’s working capital requirement.

'After a brief hiatus, diesel prices were Monday hiked by Rs 1.09 a litre, excluding state levies. The monthly increases in diesel rates, which had been put on hold just before India began voting to elect a new government, were back no sooner than polling ended today. The hikes, effective from midnight tonight, are excluding state sales tax or VAT and actual increase will be higher and will vary from city to city, the oil companies announced. Also Read: Euro-IV petrol, diesel in 50 more cities by March 2015 Diesel price in Delhi will be hiked by Rs 1.22 a litre after including taxes, to Rs 56.71 per litre, while it will cost Rs 65.21 a litre in Mumbai as against Rs 63.86 at present. State-owned oil companies, which had last hiked diesel price on March 1, will lose Rs 5.71 a litre even after today\'s hike. The Cabinet had in January last year decided that diesel prices should be raised by 40-50 paise a litre every month until losses on the fuel are wiped out. However, oil firms skipped the hikes due on April 1 and May 1 as UPA did not want to take unpopular decision during election season. The deferred hikes have now been implemented. Before today\'s increase, diesel prices had risen by a cumulative Rs 8.33 a litre in 14 instalments since January 2013. There will be no change in petrol rates even though the oil firms were losing about 50 paise a litre due to depreciation in value of rupee against the US dollar. Oil PSUs IOC   ,  BPCL   and  HPCL   had on April 1 skipped raising diesel rates as per the January 2013 decision of the Cabinet of small monthly raises, on the plea that revenue losses on the fuel have dropped below Rs 6 a litre. They again did not raise rates on May 1 even though the losses had climbed to Rs 6.80 per litre. The oil ministry had at the time of shelving the April hike stated that an expert committee headed by Kirit Parikh recommended that government provide a fixed subsidy of Rs 6 per litre on diesel and so there was no need to raise rates if the revenue losses were below this threshold. While the government is yet to accept the Parikh panel recommendations, the Oil Ministry, wary of the political fallout due to the unpopular move to raise prices, approached the poll watchdog towards March-end seeking its nod to keep monthly raises in abeyance. The Election Commission did not respond to the Ministry\'s request for over a month, a development that was cited to yet again for not raising fuel rates on May 1 even though losses had surpassed the Rs 6 a litre threshold. The Election Commission has now told the Ministry that since the revenue loss on the fuel is currently Rs 6.80 per litre, it is for the Oil Ministry to take a decision on raising rates. \"As a sequel to the under-recovery on diesel having fallen below Rs 6 per litre, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas had referred the matter to Election Commission of India on March 31, 2014. Accordingly, PSU oil marketing companies did not increase prices of diesel on April 1, 2014 and May 1, 2014. \"As the proposed change has not been accepted by the Election Commission, the oil marketing companies are required to effect both the price increases together,\" said Indian Oil Corp, the nation\'s largest fuel retailer. IOC said even after today\'s increase, oil firms will have an under-recovery (revenue loss) of Rs 5.71 a litre on diesel. Diesel rates had risen regularly barring just one time.

'tate-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd ( HPCL   ) today reported a net loss of Rs 1,734 crore in the December quarter after the government paid less than half of the due oil subsidy . HPCL had posted a net profit of Rs 147 crore in the same period a year ago. The company posted losses \"mainly on account of higher absorption of under-recoveries on sale of sensitive petroleum products,\" HPCL Director (Finance) K V Rao said. HPCL absorbed Rs 3,192 crore after the government paid only Rs 2,328 crore subsidy for selling diesel, cooking gas (LPG) and kerosene at rates lower than cost. The company had lost Rs 9,245 crore on selling diesel and cooking fuel below cost in third quarter this fiscal. It got Rs 3,705 crore from upstream firms like ONGC and Rs 2,328 crore from government, leaving an unmet gap of Rs 3,195 crore, he said.

'Even as some analysts have come out and said -- in light of recent global macro turbulence -- that equity markets are poised for a 2008-like crash, one of the country\'s leading fund managers is not being so pessimistic. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Anup Maheshwari, Executive Vice President and Head of Equities, DSP BlackRock Investment Managers, says the one measure that separates the market of 2008 from today\'s is valuation. \"The current market situation is different from 2008.

'Indian Oil Corp  (IOC) and other state-run fuel retailers have piled up inventory loss of over Rs 10,000 crore which together with depreciating rupee has severely strained their finances ahead of a revision in petrol and diesel prices. IOC along with Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd ( HPCL   ) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd ( BPCL   ) are to decide on revising petrol and diesel prices tomorrow, amidst clamour for a rate cut on falling crude oil prices. The firms, however, rue that petrol and diesel prices are not set based on trends in crude oil prices. They are benchmarked against internationally traded rates of gasoline (for petrol) and gas oil (for diesel) as well as rupee-dollar exchange rate. Industry sources said rupee has depreciated against the US dollar since the last revision on December 16, making imports costlier. Rupee has averaged Rs 63.46 to a US dollar since then as against Rs 61.95 factored in the last price cut. On top of this, margins, which is differential between raw material (crude oil price) and product rate, has halved to USD 8-9 per barrel, they said. While the slump in international crude oil prices had resulted in successive cuts in petrol and diesel prices, for oil companies they had meant inventory losses as they would typically buy crude at one rate but by the time it is processed and marketed its market value would have come down. In April-September, the three state oil firms had an inventory loss of Rs 5,300 crore which has risen by \"two to three times\" since then, a top source said. Oil firms feel people should look at the complete picture and not just base their expectations for a cut in retail prices on crude oil rates alone. A cut in prices as per the fortnightly practice of revising rates on 1st and 16th of every month, can be announced tomorrow evening only at the expense of oil companies, they said. Petrol and diesel prices were last cut on December 16 by Rs 2 per litre each. This was the eighth straight reduction in petrol prices since August, and fourth in diesel since October. Petrol in Delhi today costs Rs 61.33 a litre, the lowest in 44 months. Diesel costs Rs 50.51 a litre, the lowest since July 2013. Since August, petrol price have been cut by Rs 12.27 per litre on a cumulative basis while diesel rates in four downward revisions have been slashed by Rs 8.46 a litre. The price cuts would have been steeper but for the government deciding to make hay out of the crude oil rate slump to around USD 60 per barrel. It raised excise duty on petrol by Rs 3.75 and by Rs 2.50 a litre on diesel to mop up Rs 10,600 crore. Crude oil price in June was USD 115 per barrel. \r\n',neg

'Jet standalone net loss narrows to Rs 217.6 cr in June qtr Revenue of Jet Airways rose 17 percent to Rs 4,685.64 crore in the reporting period, while total passenger revenue rose 11.1 percent to Rs 4,262.6 crore. \r\nThe second largest airline Jet Airways    reported a standalone net loss of Rs 217.65 crore for the quarter to June, down 39 percent from the year-ago period. Revenue rose 17 percent to Rs 4,685.64 crore in the reporting period, while total passenger revenue rose 11.1 percent to Rs 4,262.6 crore, the airline said in a statement to the exchanges. Codeshare pushed overall traffic by 157 percent to 1,18,253 during the reporting period primarily driven by the strength of Etihad Airways\' alliance. International operating results improved 86 percent, and is profitable, the Naresh Goyal promoted airline said, adding that the seat factor rose 2.3 percentage points to 80.2 percent, pushing up its yield 1.8 percent. The airline termed the numbers as \"strongly improved performance\" and attributed the same to \"the result of the three-year turnaround strategy and the partnership with Etihad started to impact the business positively.\" Total number of revenue passengers who travelled with Jet Airways increased 4.3 percent to 5.19 million from 4.98 million, with passenger load factor increasing by 2.3 percentage points from 77.9 to 80.2 as the airline gained new customers. Overall RASK (revenue per available seat km) rose 6.4 percent to Rs 4.68 from Rs 4.40, while domestic RASK rose 7.4 percent to Rs 5.53 from Rs 5.15, and international RASK rose 8.2 percent to Rs 4.18 from Rs 3.86. International operations results improved 86 percent underpinned by a surge of 157 percent in codeshare traffic, which grew to 1,18,253 passengers in the first quarter. This is expected to increase further as the full extent of the codeshare expansion with Etihad and Air France, which were activated only halfway through the quarter, take effect and Jet Airways\' planned international network expands and more codeshares come online, the airline said.\r\n',neg

The aviation turbine fuel (ATF) was one factor which would have worked against Jet Airways. More or less the fuel expenses came in at Rs 1,900 crore.\" \"In that sense itself, a turnaround in the next two quarters looks a little bit improbable for Jet Airways. So Etihad will have to do a lot of synergies for Jet Airways both on its domestic and the international operations to turn things around.

So, on one hand you have Etihad deal that is happening that is even as a reason for why the stock should go up and from time to time these kinds of considerations come up and if you look at purely the fundamentals there is a price fall that has started back in aviation. You have load factors that are not improving and you have a situation probably of some kind of an over capacity in the next one-and-half to two years. \"The Etihad valuation although very high for Jet Airways and many minority investors might actually rule the fact that there is no open offer, but still one must understand that it was the investment value which is the synergies which probably Etihad thought it could realize out of Jet and minority investors of Jet have nothing to gain out of that valuation. So, if one is very enthusiastic about those synergies, you should probably go and own Etihad Airways and not Jet Airways. So, from an investor’s pint of view it’s a strict no and if investors are making some money, it’s a good idea get out,” he added.\r\n',neg

So what probably happens with a stake sale which is being circulated in media, again that is very speculative, but clearly the Gross Refinery Margin (GRM) are something that has held up for Essar Oil. But for it to return into profitability, GRM in excess USD 10 is something that the market analysts are looking at.

'Pipeline fire: RIL restores gas supply, assessing loss \r\n\r\nFire had broken out in the wee hours of Sunday in the 1,375 km-long RGTIL-operated natural gas pipeline at Sadasivapet in Medak district.\r\n\r\nReliance Industries    is in the process of assessing the gas loss due to damage of a trunk pipeline and subsequent fire at Sadasivapet in Telangana as the supply of gas has been restored. Fire had broken out in the wee hours of Sunday in the 1,375 km-long RGTIL-operated natural gas pipeline at Sadasivapet in Medak district. \"Supply of gas has been restored through the pipeline last night,\" a source told Media. The pipeline transports the gas from its KG-D6 field in Kakinada to Bharuch in Gujarat for supplying it to RIL customers. There was no loss of life or injuries due to the incident, the company had earlier said. A senior government official said the gas supply had been stopped for nearly three days for taking up necessary repair works to the damaged portion of the pipeline. \"The actual amount of gas lost in fire is still being assessed and is likely to be a fraction of what has been reported (in a section of media),\" a company statement said. Reduction or interruption of gas flow to downstream customers is expected to last for a period of about 24 to 48 hours and all authorities concerned and affected customers have been informed, the company had earlier said. The official said there will not be any inquiry from the government end as there was no financial or human loss reported in the fire.\r\n\r\n',neg

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had in 2013 claimed that RIL had deliberately drilled wells close to the boundary that its Krishna Godavari basin KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) block shares with the state-owned firm\'s Godavari Block (G-4) and that some of its gas may have been pumped out from the adjoining block. US-based consultant DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) has been appointed by the two firms to study if the two blocks are contiguous and have a common gas reservoir from which gas can be produced from either side. HSBC Global Research in a note said the underlying contract -- production sharing contract (PSC), provides for the resolution of such a dispute. A full chapter on resolution of such a dispute through unit development has been devoted in the PSC. \"As per the terms of the contract, if a reservoir is situated partly within a contract area belonging to a party and partly in a different contract area, any of the parties could write to the government, and the government then will ask the two contractors to collaborate and agree on a joint development of reservoir within a stipulated time period. \"If parties fail to agree to do so, the government can force the parties to prepare and execute such a joint plan,\" it said. RIL began gas production from KG-D6 block in April 2009 while ONGC is yet to begin development work on gas fields in G-4 that were discovered more than 12 years back. \"PSC does not provide for an explicit retrospective penalty on any of the parties that produced from its approved contract area (mining lease area) as per an approved field development plan, if the other party to the dispute failed to seek such a unit development,\" HSBC said. ONGC had sought compensation for the gas belonging to it that RIL had produced. Sources said D&M has in its preliminary comments stated that the reservoir in the two neighbouring blocks are connected and there is no unconnected area in G-4. ONGC claims that 11.9 billion cubic meters (bcm) of its gas may have been produced from RIL\'s KG-D6 field. This at a gas price of USD 4.2 per mmBtu, will be worth less than USD 180 million. Even this it can get only after field expenses as well as taxes and royalty paid by RIL is deducted, they said. D&M is likely to submit its report on the issue by next month. And as per Supreme Court order the Oil Ministry will have six months from the date the report is submitted to decide if ONGC is entitled to any compensation from RIL.\r\n\r\n',neg

'RIL again loses most profitable tag, this time to IOC \r\n\r\nThe state-run firm booked Rs 118 crore more profit than the Mukesh Ambani-run firm net income of Rs 6,318 crore. \r\n\r\nWithin two quarters of losing its 23-year-old reign as the country\'s most profitable company to TCS in the December quarter, Reliance Industries   was again humbled in the June quarter, this time by Indian Oil. The state-run firm booked Rs 118 crore more profit than the Mukesh Ambani-run firm net income of Rs 6,318 crore. Better refining margins arising from lower oil prices and almost full payback of subsidies by the government helped the nation\'s biggest oil company Indian Oil Corporation   (IOC) to report a massive more than two-fold jump in the June quarter net profit at Rs 6,436 crore. IOC\'s refining margins soared to a seven-year high during the reporting quarter. For Reliance, losing the numero uno slot comes within two quarter as in the December 2014 earnings season as well it had lost out to TCS as it booked more profit than RIL with a net income of Rs 5,328 crore. The loss in the December 2014 quarter was the end of RIL\'s 23-year run as the most profitable firm with a net profit in the country, overtaking the long-standing champion Reliance which saw its profit dip to Rs 5,256 crore as falling crude prices hurt its core business. The third most profitable company in the June quarter was Tata Consultancy Services   with net income at Rs 5,684 crore for the June quarter, up 2 percent y-o-y, while its revenue rose 16.1 percent to Rs 25,668 crore. With this, IOC thus also becomes the first domestic company to sniff at the billion-dollar club in quarterly earnings based on the closing price of the rupee on the earnings day (65.10) while it was well in the club on the as the rupee had closed at 63.64 on June 30. During the reporting quarter the crude prices on an average fell 43.5 percent for both the companies. Even in the December 2014 quarter, IOC was very close to RIL with quarterly net profit of Rs 6,285 crore. The loss of RIL is more pronounced as only last fiscal year (FY15) the company had overtaken the state-run oil and gas giant ONGC to become the most profitable company in the country both on an annual basis with a annual net income of Rs 23,566 crore, against the public sector company\'s net profit of Rs 18,334 crore. \r\n\r\n',neg

'Banks crash; Nomura says base rate cut likely to hit NIM \r\nMost banks till date have cut base rates by around 25-30 basis points and after this cut by HDFC Bank, their base rates are around 35-65 bps higher than HDFC Bank – such a large differential is difficult to sustain beyond 1-2 months, feels Nomura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recent base rate cuts are likely to have an impact on net interest margin of banks in near-to-medium term but that is credit-positive in long run, says Nomura. HDFC Bank   on Monday announced a big 35-basis point cut in its base rate to 9.35 percent from 9.7 percent (taking a cumulative base rate cut of 65 basis points from January 2015), the lowest in industry. It is the third rate cut by the bank. The country\'s second largest private sector lender cut base rate by 15 bps on June 17 and by 15 bps on April 7. Canara Bank also cut base rate by 10 basis points to 9.9 percent on Monday. Most banks till date have cut base rates by around 25-30 basis points and after this cut by HDFC Bank, their base rates are around 35-65 bps higher than HDFC Bank – such a large differential is difficult to sustain beyond 1-2 months, feels Nomura. The current base rate of SBI   is 9.7 percent, Bank of Baroda   9.9 percent, Kotak Mahindra Bank   9.75 percent, Axis Bank   9.85 percent and ICICI Bank   9.7 percent. According to the brokerage, banks in the interim will have to take some hit on NIMs if they intend to match the base rate cut of HDFC Bank. Deposit rate cuts, which have been intensified since July 2015, will provide some offset but that will take six-nine months. \"While the term deposit rate cuts look sufficient to offset the cut in base rates to a large extent, more than 50 percent of the around 60 bps cut has been after June 2015 and hence this should take at least six-nine months to reflect in banks’ cost of funds,\" says Nomura. Banks have cut term deposit rates by around 50-65 bps from January 2015 levels. HDFC Bank is able to take such a large base rate cut as only 30-40 percent of its loan book is linked to the base rate but that is not the case with corporate banks. Corporate banks like ICICI Bank , Axis Bank , YES Bank , PSUs have around 65-75 percent of their loan book linked to the base rate and their NIM impact will be higher due to base rate cuts. Also for corporate banks, majority of the incremental lending, especially for corporates (more than 50 percent of the last 12 months), was through bonds/ECBs where yields are significantly lower than the base rate already and the base rate cut will be an additional burden on profitability, says Nomura. For auto NBFCs, base rate cuts are positive as more than 50 percent of their funding is through banks, but for housing finance companies, a base rate cut will be a marginal negative as their lending yields will come under pressure, feels the brokerage. Additionally, Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings on nine Indian banks. \"The long-term issuer default ratings (IDR) on State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of Baroda , Bank of Baroda (New Zealand), Punjab National Bank   (PNB), Canara Bank   , IDBI Bank   , ICICI Bank and Axis Bank have been affirmed at \'BBB-\' while Indian Bank   has been affirmed at \'BB+\'. The outlook on the IDRs is stable,\" it explains.

SSBEA may go for an indefinite strike in associate banks to be followed by indefinite stir by AIBEA in all banks by end of December if their demands are not conceded by then, Mishra warned. The other demands include increase in quantum of staff housing loans, recruitment of sub-staff and part-time employees and not imposing SBI service conditions and career progression in associate banks.

Out of the 23 observations, 10 were related to the injectables facility, 4 were on the oral solids facility, 8 were related to quality control labs and 1 was on warehousing. In its letter, the drug regulator said that Sun Pharma failed to establish and follow appropriate written procedures and all lapses are examples of serious current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) violations. It also added that the company\'s responsibility to ensure third party audit includes full evaluation of systems, operations and procedures.

'continued the weak trend caused by continuously falling commodity prices. The losses rake up, with only the miners reporting a positive PAT. We do believe though that with Q3FY16, the process of bottoming-out of earnings has started. While the process can be accelerated in the ferrous pack through government intervention, that in the non-ferrous pack can take support from incremental news of capacity cuts flowing in globally. Does this mean corresponding plateauing of sector multiples? Probably yes. Q3FY16 though is forgettable with the ferrous pack reeling from the price cuts witnessed QoQ (between 3-6\%, with Tata Steel   lowest at 3\%) leading to a 20\% sequential EBITDA drop in the ferrous segment. The non-ferrous segment fares no better, particularly with the disappointment in store for Hind Zinc, which witnessed a sharp cost escalation in Q3FY16, and the pack (barring Vedanta) witnesses a 30\% QoQ EBITDA drop. NMDC   , with a 12\% QoQ volume increase, limits its QoQ EBITDA drop to 10\%. Aluminium operations churn out respectable performance yet again for Vedanta   , but weak performance from Cairn and Hind Zinc   drags EBITDA down by ~20\% QoQ. We feel Vedanta’s underperformance over the last quarter is overdone, and hence would like to present the stock as our top pick as we move into CY16. Also, we would like to highlight that despite the recent outperformance of the steel stocks, imposition of Minimum Import Price can result in significant price outperformance for Tata/JSPL, while the upside looks limited for JSW / SAIL   . > Ferrous pack reels under pricing pressure. Industry demand growth has surprised in Q3FY16 with Oct/Nov’15 registering 7\%/11\% demand growth respectively. Similar buoyancy has been witnessed in sector volumes as well barring JSW Steel on account of shutdowns undertaken to augment capacity. Realisations though have played spoilsport particularly in the longs segment with average realisation drop in the pack between 5-6\% QoQ, Tata Steel standalone being the only exception. Tata Steel Europe (TSE) though has suffered on account of compressing spreads in Europe and the continued effort to streamline operations in Tata Steel UK (EBITDA loss in TSE expected at US$31/te). This leads to 23\% QoQ drop in consolidated EBITDA expected in Q3FY16 on top of the 34\% QoQ drop that Q2FY16 witnessed. > Miners manage to report positive PAT in Q3FY16, all others being in the red. NMDC again manages to report 4\% YoY volume growth as prices have declined ~43\% YoY. GMDC is expected to witness the full brunt of realisation cut undertaken in September, and is expected to witness ~26\% YoY decline in EBITDA. > Declining commodity prices take out any chance of earnings stability in the non-ferrous pack. Hind Zinc is expected to disappoint as higher costs led to a ~30\% YoY/QoQ EBITDA decline. Vedanta has been further impacted by the continued weakness in Cairn’s performance, yet its aluminium/power operations are resilient (details inside). Hindalco has started witnessing the benefits of lower domestic coal prices as both its new smelters are now without captive coal blocks. Q3FY16 though, is forgettable for the company.\r\n',neg

'Tata Steel   has cut down on iron ore mining operations as well as stabilisation measures at its plant in Canada due to \"challenging conditions\" in steel and ore markets, a move that will impact jobs. The scaling down is taking place at Tata Steel Minerals Canada\'s (TSMC) Direct Shipping Ore (DSO) project involving mining, crushing, washing, screening and shipping the sinter fines and pellet fines to Tata Steel\'s European steel making facilities. TSMC is a joint venture between Tata Steel and the Alberta-based New Millennium Iron Corporation (NML) with the steelmaker being the majority partner with 94 percent stake. It is developing iron ore deposits in Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada. \"TSMC, in which NML holds a 6 percent interest, is temporarily scaling down winter operations including stabilisation activities of the plant at its DSO Project,\" NML said in a regulatory filing earlier this month. The filing further said: \"This action is in response to challenging conditions in the steel and iron ore markets and is expected to be reviewed on an ongoing basis. The number of TSMC employees affected will be based on operational needs, including services and maintenance.\" In October last year, Tata Steel had said it will review its agreement with NML on developing iron ore sites in Canada. Tata Steel, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Tata Steel Global Minerals Holdings Pte Ltd, owns about 26.2 percent of NML\'s shares and is its largest shareholder and strategic partner. According to market analysts, the last few years have been one of the most challenging for iron ore industry. Prices of the ore have plunged, particularly on account of subdued demand in China. It is at a time when new supply from previously committed projects in Australia and Brazil is flooding the market. This have resulted in weak financing conditions and sharp declines in sales and profits for all mining companies. Iron ore is the key ingredient used in making steel. Due to the economic slowdown globally and in China, the world\'s biggest consumer of steel, demand for the metal has gone down amidst continued production. It has not only impacted steel prices, but has also had a cascading effect on raw materials including iron ore. Yesterday, Tata Steel signed an in-principle agreement with the Quebec government to develop iron ore deposits in the Canadian province, a move that can help the steelmaker reduce its raw material costs. It relates to the provincial government\'s participation with TS Global Minerals Holdings\' in DSO Project in the Schefferville area. Both parties will also work on developing the transit for iron ore from Arnaud Junction to the multiuser dock at the Port of Sept-Iles.\r\n',neg

If you just calculate that those USD 13.2 billion, it works out at the current rate to about maybe Rs 80,000 crore and that is the debt they have in their books.\" \"We are all talking of Rs 50,000-55,000 crore debt, that is wrong. It is a Rs 80,000 crore debt in the books of the company as on September, 30.

They have not been able to do anything,\" he added. \"They have recently completed three million tonne expansion in Kalinganagar steel plant with an outlay of Rs 22,000 crore in Odisha.

And suddenly now at the bearish or at the lowest end of the cycle, you are adding Rs 22,000 crore. Obviously, interest and depreciation which were otherwise getting capatilised will start charging to the profit and loss now, so even the domestic operations will go worse.\" \"Now, come quickly on this long product distribution. They have 4,700 employees in that. The press release of the company says that in guarded words, they could turn it around. They have tried their level best, now they want some strategic partner. In fact in the past also, for which they have signed a letter of intent, they had a similar agreement in the past also, but the deal fell through. It did not go through.\" \"Suppose even if it goes through 500 sterling pounds, maybe about Rs 5,000 crore, what are we talking of?

On other hand, because you have increased your investments of Rs 22,000 crore on the domestic turf, you want to have something balancing exit.

But what will happen to the profitability? Because let us understand as I said, Rs 22,000 crore which was otherwise getting capitalised, will start getting charged to the P&L, if not from this quarter, maybe from the next quarter.\" \"So, these are all pure technical calls.

In fact, if you really ask me, I will not be surprised to see the price of Rs 150 in Tata Steel   in the next 365 days. Believe me, that kind of pain because you have no light at the end of the tunnel for Corus operations.

'Tata Steel   is in talks to sell its struggling British-based unit to investment firm Greybull Capital, the two firms said in a statement on Tuesday.

Reuters reported on Monday that Greybull had emerged as the favourite in the sale process. One source said the deal was probably worth less than 500 million pounds, and that the buyer was not likely to take on any debt. \"Greybull Capital confirms that it has signed a letter of intent with Tata Steel...

'Tata Steel   wants to sell its plant in northern England to give it the \"best chance of survival\" as the UK industry has been struggling under a flood of cheap steel being pumped in from China, which has depressed prices. According to The Sunday Times, the Indian steel giant hopes the sale of its Scunthorpe plant in north Lincolnshire will take place by April next year. The firm is weighing up the closure of its long-products arm, of which Scunthorpe forms the core. A plan to sell it to US industrial tycoon Gary Klesch collapsed in the summer, the newspaper had earlier reported. Various bidders are believed to be interested and there is a possibility of a management buyout as well. The UK\'s Department for Business is understood to be trying to attract buyers with a promise of long-term supply contracts, including a deal to feed Network Rail with steel for its multi-billion-pound overhaul of the railways. But the chances of a rescue that would keep open Scunthorpe\'s two blast furnaces preserving the site as one of just two in Britain capable of turning iron ore into steel are thought to be slim, the newspaper said. That could mean Scunthorpe is reduced to a finishing site for steel shipped in from abroad. The UK industry has been struggling under a flood of cheap steel being pumped in from China, which has depressed prices. The problems have been exacerbated by the strength of sterling and high energy costs. Tata had bought the Anglo-Dutch steel maker Corus in 2007 for 6.2 billion pounds, just before the financial crisis hit, and renamed it Tata Steel Europe. The firm said it is \"assessing all strategic options\" for the division and doing all it can to give it the \"best chance of survival.\" The Community union, which represents workers at Tata, said: \"We believe there\'s a sustainable future for the industry.\r\n',neg

'Global agency Moody\'s today downgraded the outlook on Tata Steel   from Stable to Negative on account of persistent weakness in the global commodity prices and resulting negative impact on the steelmaker. \"Moody\'s Investors Service has affirmed Tata Steel\'s Ba1 corporate family rating (CFR) and changed the rating outlook to negative from stable,\" it said in a statement. The agency affirmed Tata Steel UK Holdings\' (TSUKH) CFR and probability of default rating at B2/B2-PD, and changed the ratings outlook to stable from positive, it added. The rating actions reflect the persistent weakness in global steel prices led by China\'s economic slowdown and the resulting negative impact on the credit profiles of Tata Steel and TSUKH, Moody\'s said. \"Our rating actions are premised on a near-term increase in global demand for steel being unlikely, and as such, a material recovery in steel prices remains a low probability,\" Moody\'s Vice President and Senior Analyst Kaustubh Chaubal said. India\'s steel imports were up 42 percent by volume in H1 of 2015-16 from the same period last year. As a result, Indian hot rolled coil prices (HRC) fell 37 percent, leading to Tata Steel India\'s (TSI) realisations/tonne falling about 18 percent to Rs 40,853 a tonne. Steel prices in Europe have also fallen sharply, due to persistent overcapacity in Europe, and high levels of cheaper imports, particularly from China, it said. Tata Steel\'s European operations reported a 77 per cent drop in its EBITDA/tonne at Rs 649 for H1 2015-16, predominantly because of an EBITDA loss in Q2 FY16, it added. \"Moody\'s rating actions result from the weakening in Tata Steel\'s and TSUKH\'s operating performance and debt protection metrics, and our expectation that a continued contraction in earnings will be evidenced. This is given the challenging conditions facing global steel industry, and in particular, Tata Steel\'s key markets of India and Europe,\" Chaubal, who is also the Lead Analyst for Tata Steel and TSUKH, said. While TSI\'s backward integrated operations continue to help in sourcing 100 percent of its iron ore and 40 percent of its coking coal requirements, the benefit is somewhat diminished, Moody\'s said. This is due to low raw material prices and increasing cost of mining in India, due to contributions to the District Mineral Foundation that have increased mining costs, it added.  \r\n',neg

'Tata Steel   Ltd, Europe\'s second-largest steel producer, said on Thursday it will press ahead with cost cuts and restructuring to cope with a surge in cheap Chinese exports to Europe and India, its two key markets. Tata, which posted a surprise 22 percent rise in second-quarter net profit after selling some non-?essential holdings, is trying to revive its struggling British operation and has cut thousands of jobs since buying Anglo-Dutch Corus in 2007. \"We have seen huge pressure on (steel) prices ongoing and the strong pound has exasperated ?the point,\" Karl-Ulrich Koehler, CEO of Tata Steel in Europe, told reporters. \"Our focus on cost reductions and restructuring will have to continue.\" Koehler said Tata would look at all options for its European long products business. The crisis in Britain\'s steel sector escalated last week as Tata Steel blamed its decision to cut British jobs on a flood of cheap imports, particularly from China, as well as tumbling steel prices. Net profit at Tata Steel, a division of a hotels-to-automobiles conglomerate, rose to 15.29 billion rupees (USD 232.9 million) on a consolidated basis in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from 12.54 billion rupees a year earlier. Analysts had forecast a net profit of 11.8 billion rupees, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. Tata\'s profit was boosted by 28 billion rupees earned from the sale of quoted investments during the quarter, including part of its stake in Tata Motors   . Tata also said the \"rapid and sharp deterioration\" in the British business environment had forced it to take a non-cash charge in the period which, together with restructuring charges and other provisions, totalled 87 billion rupees. China makes nearly half the world\'s 1.6 billion tonnes of steel. With growth slowing at home, it is expected to export a record 100 million tonnes to world markets this year to help address its spare steel making capacity. India imposed a 20 percent import tax on some steel products in September to mitigate the damage to domestic companies. Despite this, steel prices in India will remain under pressure until there is a \"meaningful uptick\" in demand in Asia\'s third-largest economy, said TV Narendran, Tata Steel\'s managing director for India and Southeast Asia.\r\n',neg

'Tata Steel    has proposed to revise the compensation package for families displaced by its Gopalpur project in Ganjam district. \"We have submitted a fresh compensation package to Odisha government. The package will be announced after the government gives its go-ahead,\" Vice-president of the project Arun Mishra said yesterday. In 1996, people of Sindhigaon, Badapaur, Patrapur, Kalipalli and Paikapada villages near Gopalpur were displaced when the company acquired 2,970 acres for the then proposed shore-based mega steel plant. People of eight other villages were affected by the project, officials said. Tatas later shelved the project and decided to set up an industrial park and multi-product special economic zone (SEZ). Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik laid the stone of the proposed park in August 2010. The delay in execution of the project has led to the discontent among the displaced. Besides a special package in tune with the Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) Policy, they are demanding permanent job to one member of every affected family. Tata Rehabilitation Village Development Committee had submitted a memorandum to Tata Group\'s chairman Cyrus P Mistry during his visit to the area on September 2. It had demanded Rs 15 lakh compensation each to the affected families and fresh enumeration of those displaced by the project. \"The company will formulate a recruitment policy and submit it to the district administration. A skill development centre will be set up in the district to train local youths,\" Misra said. He said the Gopalpur project was a priority for the company. \"We\'ll be setting up a ferro chrome plan of 55,000 tonne per annum capacity, as an anchor project in the proposed park at a cost of Rs 400 crore.

Steel has been in crisis for a long time this is not just a new thing.\" Thousands of jobs were lost last year with cutbacks and the closure of steelworks in England and Scotland involving Tata and other UK-based steel companies. Steel unions have called for urgent action from the UK government to prevent further job losses. Rob Edwards, lead organiser of the Community trade union, said: \"The problem is there\'s cheap steel imports from China, all the business rates are wrong, the environmental taxes are wrong. \"It is a very difficult situation and I think people underestimate how important the steel industry is to Wales.\" Tata Steel Europe employs 17,000 in the UK, with 6,360 of those across its plants in Wales. In October last year, the firm had announced that it would cut nearly 1,200 jobs at its plants in Scunthorpe in northern England and at Lanarkshire in Scotland. Tata Steel is in talks to clinch a deal for the sale of some of these units.\r\n',neg
'Tata Steel   , the biggest steelmaker in Britain, will axe 1,050 jobs in the country, Sky News reported on Sunday, on top of the 1,170 cuts it announced last year due to low steel prices. The steelmaker said in October it would cut 900 jobs in Scunthorpe in Northern England and 270 in Scotland. On Sunday, Sky News reported the firm would cut 750 jobs at its Port Talbot plant in Wales and 300 at other British sites. British steelmakers pay some of the highest energy costs and green taxes in the world and are also struggling to compete with record Chinese steel imports. Tata Steel did not immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by Reuters. Sky News said the company would announce the cuts on Monday.\r\n',neg
'today downgraded steel major Tata Steel   to \'BB-\', a low investment grade rating, over persistent subdued operating performance amid subdued demand and low steel prices. The agency lowered its long-term corporate credit rating on Tata Steel to \'BB-\' from \'BB\', adding that the outlook for the Mumbai-based firm is stable. S&P also lowered its long-term corporate credit rating on Tata Steel UK Holdings to \'B+\' from \'BB-\' but maintained a stable outlook on the firm struggling with high debt and lower sales. The rating on Tata Steel UK has been lowered following the downgrade of its parent Tata Steel, the agency said. \"We downgraded Tata Steel because we expect the company\'s weak cash flows and compressed profitability to keep its leverage high over the next 12-18 months,\" S&P Credit Analyst Vishal Kulkarni said in a statement. The ratings agency lowered its assessment of the firm\'s financial risk profile to highly leveraged from aggressive to reflect its weakened cash flow leverage ratios, he added. \"Subdued demand and low steel prices have kept operating performance weak at Tata Steel\'s India and European operations. We expect the company\'s operating performance to improve, but only gradually, beginning in fiscal 2017 (year ending March 31, 2017),\" Kulkarni said. Profitability at Tata Steel\'s backward integrated India operations has suffered by the more than 40 per cent fall in the average selling prices of steel in the domestic market over the past 18 months. Steel prices have come down globally in line with the decline in iron ore and coking coal prices. Besides, demand is likely to stay subdued and production volumes should remain largely stable, S&P said. \"Tata Steel\'s new steel facility in the state of Odisha has been delayed and will now come on-stream in the last quarter of fiscal 2016, more than a year later than we had previously expected,\" Kulkarni said. \"We expect the company\'s debt to remain high and free operating cash flows to remain negative until fiscal 2018,\" he added. Tata Steel\'s European operations continue to face tough operating conditions. Volumes were slightly low as demand remained sluggish and imports increased,\r\n',neg

The transaction is expected to be completed within the fourth quarter of the financial year 2015-2016, subject to the execution of the agreement and completion of certain conditions precedent, it added. The transfer of the consumer healthcare business to Cipla Health will enable the Mumbai-based firm to participate in the attractive and growing over-the-counter market. \"This business requires a specialised FMCG kind of focus, and a separate subsidiary would enable the company to attract the right talent and provide the focus and attention required for this business,\" the company said. The Indian consumer health care is a USD 4 billion market and is growing at a CAGR of 15 percent. It is expected to be a USD 10 billion market by 2020. Shares of Cipla today ended at Rs 635.20 apiece on the BSE, up 1.89 percent from previous close.\r\n\r\n',pos

'Leading generic drug maker Cipla   on Thursday said that it expects 20 percent growth in revenues in the current fiscal (FY 16). \"Our first quarter ended June 2015 results have shown an exceptional growth both in turnover and overall profitability. We are optimistic that in the current year, our revenues will grow by 20 percent and our profitability will be commensurate with this,\" Cipla\'s chairman Y K Hamied told shareholders at the company\'s 79th annual general meeting (AGM) here on Thursday. The company\'s turnover doubled in last five year\'s to Rs 11,000 crore in FY 15. The net profit marginally declined due to statutory price reductions of a number of drug formulations in the domestic market and major diverse long term investments undertaken in building its portfolio and pipeline of newer products, Hamied said. Cipla is having presence in over 150 countries and manufacture drugs in over 50 dosages and has a portfolio in excess of 1,500 products. \"We expect sustained growth in our business. We are hopeful of doubling our domestic sales by 2020 from the present 40 percent of our total sales. Our US business will also increase to 20 percent from the present 8 percent,\" Cipla managing director Subhanu Saxena told reporters on the sidelines of the AGM. \"Our top priorities for FY 16 are build and launch a robust pipeline for today and the future, strengthen our operations across manufacturing, supply chain and procurement, execute our growth strategies and integrate the recent deals signed,\" Saxena added. The company is in a significant investment phase for the future and will continue to invest in our pipeline and capabilities, Saxena said, adding that its pipeline of projects is secure and more than 80 percent of our critical launches are on track.

Commenting on drug pricing systems, Hamied said, \"There is no positive drug policy in our country. The drug pricing system also requires a fresh reasonable approach.

'Drug major Cipla   Ltd on Monday said it is ready to launch low dose \'Efavirenz\' used in treatment of HIV infection. On the eve of World AIDS day, the company announced \"its readiness to supply its combinations Tenofovir/Emtricitabine/ Efavirenz and Tenofovir/Lamivudine/Efavirenz with a dose of 400 mg of Efavirenz as a first-line initial therapy for HIV infection\", Cipla said in a BSE filing. \"Studies now support the use of Efavirenz 400 mg as a substitute for Efavirenz 600 mg in cases where there is no co-infection with tuberculosis. Efavirenz 600 mg is currently used in antiretroviral therapy (ART) and is highly effective. \"However, it is known to have significant side effects, which can be very distressing for those taking it for treatment of HIV infection,\" it added. Cipla further said: \"Studies found that the reduced dose of 400 mg Efavirenz was non-inferior to the standard dose of 600 mg Efavirenz dose when combined with Tenofovir/ Emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) and Tenofovir/ Lamivudine (TDF/ 3TC) as initial HIV therapy. Both doses demonstrated similar safety profiles.\" Citing UNAIDS data, Cipla said there are approximately 37 million people worldwide living with HIV of which around 15.8 million people are reported to be receiving ART. WHO recently announced that it recommended to make ART available to all HIV-infected patients as soon as they are tested positive. The company said Efavirenz 400 mg, will also significantly reduce the cost of treatment. \"This strategy should dramatically decrease HIV transmission but will require large additional resources, as the cost of ART remains substantial in spite of price reductions by manufacturers,\" it added. Reducing the dose of Efavirenz in current first-line combination therapy to 400 mg will contribute to reducing costs without modifying the effectiveness of treatment.

India Ratings expects compressed natural gas (CNG) and piped natural gas (PNG domestic) prices to be revised downward. It further expects a Rs 2.1-2.3/scm cut in PNG prices and Rs 2.8-3.0/kg reduction in CNG prices. This will make CNG 44-45 percent more competitive than diesel, compared with 39 percent currently, while PNG would become 1-2 percent more competitive than subsidised LPG, compared with a negative 8 percent currently, the ratings agency states. Over April-September 2015, diesel price declined by 8 percent, while that of CNG remained unchanged, thus lowering the fuel competitiveness of CNG. This is the second domestic gas price reduction and is driven by the decline in average gas prices prevalent at the reference hubs over the period July 2014-June 2015, the report states. The first downward price revision was to USD 4.66/mmbtu (million British thermal unit) from USD 5.05/mmbtu on April 1, 2015. The average Henry Hub gas prices declined to USD 3.33/mmbtu from USD 4.35/mmbtu over January-December 2014. The government announced on Wednesday that natural gas prices, according to a formula approved by the government in October last year, will fall to USD 4.24 per million British thermal unit on net calorific value (NCV) basis from the current USD 5.50 per mmBtu. On gross calorific value (GCV) basis, the new gas price for October 1 to March 31 would be USD 3.82 per mmBtu as compared to USD 4.66 currently, officials said. However, India Ratings says the benefit from reduced gas price will be partly offset by the near 6 percent rupee depreciation over April-September 2015. Thus, the net impact of the reduced domestic gas prices in rupee terms would be nearly 11-16 percent.\r\n',pos

'GAIL Q1 net seen up 34\%; gas trading, petchem biz key:\r\n say decline in profitability of gas trading business (weak spot LNG market) and petrochemical business (higher gas prices) will be key for GAIL\r\nGAIL   is expected to report April-June quarter net profit at Rs 684.4 crore, up 34 percent from Rs 510.8 crore in last quarter. According to a CNBC-TV18 poll, total income is seen up 7 percent at Rs 15244.5 crore versus Rs 14270.6 crore quarter-on-quarter.  During the quarter, EBITDA is likely to grow 82 percent at Rs 1171.7 crore against Rs 643.6 crore  (Q-o-Q). EBITDA margin may come in at 7.7 percent compared to 4.5 percent on an sequential basis. Analysts polled by CNBC-TV18 say decline in profitability of gas trading business (weak spot LNG market) and petrochemical business (higher gas prices) will be key for GAIL. EBITDA in petrochemical segment is expected to fall sharply due to fall in oil-linked petchem prices and rise in gas cost as use of imported LT LNG accounts for 85 percent of gas used to produce ethylene. In the LPG and other liquid hydrocarbons segment, EBITDA is expected to decline on lower LPG realisation and higher domestic gas cost. Gas trading EBITDA is assumed at Rs 260 versus a loss of Rs 30 crore in Q1 FY15, as there was a one-off loss in last year on account of sale of imported LNG at administered pricing mechanism (APM) prices which was recouped in subsequent quarter Subsidy burden for the quarter is assumed nil.\r\n',pos

'Oil Ministry to give CNG marketing licence The Ministry on March 5 issued \'Draft Guidelines for granting Marketing Rights for CNG as Transportation Fuel, including setting up CNG Stations\' wherein any entity that has invested Rs 500 crore in oil and gas infrastructure can get rights/license to retail the fuel to automobiles by setting up CNG stations.\r\nOil Ministry is looking to wrest powers to give CNG retailing licence from sectoral regulator PNGRB as it has issued draft guidelines detailing eligibility for rights to sell fuel to automobiles. The Ministry on March 5 issued \'Draft Guidelines for granting Marketing Rights for CNG as Transportation Fuel, including setting up CNG Stations\' wherein any entity that has invested Rs 500 crore in oil and gas infrastructure can get rights/license to retail the fuel to automobiles by setting up CNG stations. While the Union government had authorised entities like  Indraprastha Gas Ltd and Mahanagar Gas Ltd for retailing CNG to automobiles in Delhi and Mumbai respectively in early 2000, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has been doing so through bid rounds since its establishment in 2006. In the draft guidelines, the ministry stated that like the companies which invested a minimum of Rs 2,000 crore in oil and gas infrastructure were granted marketing rights for petrol, diesel and ATF through the March 2002 notification, entities investing a minimum of Rs 500 crore will be eligible for marketing rights for CNG. Also, entities authorised by PNGRB or Central Government would also be eligible. \"The eligible entities under these guidelines shall apply to the Government for issuance of \'Grant of Marketing Rights for CNG as transportation fuel\',\" the guideline says. Since 2006, entities apply to PNGRB and not the government for rights to retail CNG alongside selling natural gas as fuel within city limits. While PNGRB has been issuing the licence to retail CNG as well as piped cooking gas (PNG), the ministry guidelines pertain only to rights to sell CNG. \"The entities which have already been granted marketing rights for petrol, diesel and ATF as transportation fuel, under Resolution dated March 8, 2002 will be deemed to have such grants of marketing rights for CNG as transportation fuel,\" it said. In 2002, state-owned  Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) besides Reliance Industries, Essar Oil   , Royal Dutch Shell and Numaligarh Refineries had won authorisation to set up petrol pumps to sell petrol and diesel. Besides these firms, fuel retailers  Indian Oil Corp (IOC),  Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and  Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) as well as gas utility  GAIL India Ltd will be eligible for CNG marketing rights.\r\n',pos

'Keep Godrej Industries, Dabur in portfolio: is of the view that one can keep Godrej Industries and Dabur India in the portfolio.\r\n\" Godrej Industries   particularly has spent a lot of time around Rs 380 for the last six-seven months. In December, 2014 it was around Rs 380 and then it came down to Rs 300. Then it recovered towards Rs 380 again. In between it moved above Rs 400 levels also. I think that downside in the stock seems to be very limited and it is a holding company of Godrej Properties and Godrej Consumer Products .\" \"The positive surprise which is coming to me is the outperformance of Godrej Properties. The volumes that I saw in it were much better and fundamentally also the sales are picking up in it, which is not there in the industry. So overall Godrej Industries\' performance should pick up from these levels and if you look at the open interest (OI) positions, the leverage has been very low. That is what the trigger point is, it may be just because of cash selling. We are not expecting that because the stock has already spent much of time and the delivery pick up, which has started recently from Rs 375-380 range, that will provide the support. We remain positive in this and our target on the higher side is Rs 435-440 on immediate basis,\" he said. \" Dabur India   \'s results were also very good, the sales figures were very good and since then along with the delivery, if you look at he OI in futures, around 24 percent of OI has been added. I believe these are long positions and Rs 260-290 was the range for Dabur. It has taken out this range in the month of July. Since then it has been forming a base above Rs 290 levels.\" \"I think it is very much possible that whatever long additions are coming in, they are going to take the stock towards much higher levels and it is possible Rs 335-340 can also be seen towards this expiry or possibly in the next series. So one should remain long in these two stocks. Looking at the consolidation in the market, I think these are good stocks with a little bit lower beta to be there in your portfolio,\" he added.\r\n',pos

'HDFC Bank sees green shoots as Indian companies borrow again\r\n\r\nMUMBAI (Reuters) - HDFC Bank, India\'s largest lender by market value, said it is beginning to see \"green shoots\" in corporate loan growth, as companies begin to borrow and spend again after almost two years of reining in.\r\nThe combination of a more conservative stance among state-run banks - hit by bad loans - and a lack of demand as the economy slowed, has held back Indian business lending. But there are signs of a change.\r\nHDFC Bank\'s long-time managing director, Aditya Puri, said he saw early hints of a recovery among automobile, telecoms and consumer goods, and even small and medium companies.\r\n\"This is more working capital (demand) at the beginning, but we are starting to see term loan growth in the last month or two,\" he said in an interview at the bank\'s Mumbai headquarters.\r\nPuri, whose conservative, retail-focused bank\'s profit has outpaced rivals for a decade, says he expects Indian banking sector loan growth to come in at 12-14 percent this fiscal year to March - probably ahead of last year\'s 12.6 percent but a slowdown from over 20 percent six years ago.\r\nHis bank should be ahead of the market by 5 to 6 percentage points, he added.\r\nTo maintain growth in the face of a corporate slowdown, HDFC Bank, like others, has bet on lending to individuals, boosting unsecured products such as credit cards and personal loans.\r\nThat segment, targeted by rivals such as ICICI and State Bank of India, is among the market\'s most competitive. But Puri brushed off worries HDFC Bank could take on excess risk in the race for margins.\r\n\"There is no need to go up the risk ladder or down the margin ladder,\" he said, adding HDFC Bank focuses on India\'s \"middle and upper middle\".\r\nRURAL PUSH\r\nRun by former Citibank executive Puri since its launch in 1994, HDFC Bank was for a while the world\'s most expensive bank, as investors cheered its consistent double-digit growth.\r\nPuri says this growth rate is sustainable, thanks to a conscious effort to embrace technology and an aggressive push into smaller towns and villages across India.\r\nIt has been making inroads into those areas for the last three years and they now account for roughly a fifth of its book. Unlike its public sector rivals, HDFC Bank does not have a network of branches outside the cities.\r\nBusiness there, Puri says, is growing at twice the clip of India\'s large cities and should make up 40 percent of the bank\'s loan and deposit book over time, thanks to technology that allows him to offer cheap, quick and personalised products.\r\nBeing a retail-focused bank, HDFC Bank has sidestepped a damaging infrastructure lending boom, and so has minimal bad debts, unlike almost all other major lenders in India.\r\nHDFC Bank has also increased its investment banking presence, but Puri said he would not compete for the top spots in India\'s league tables, given rock-bottom fees paid by the Indian state and large corporates.',pos

'MUMBAI (Reuters) - HDFC Bank Ltd, India\'s second-biggest private sector lender by assets, said on Thursday it was optimistic of growing loans on the back of faster economic expansion after reporting net profit grew more than a fifth in the March quarter.\r\nThe lender said net profit rose to 28.07 billion rupees ($444 million) in its fiscal fourth quarter from 23.27 billion rupees a year ago. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 27.8 billion rupees, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.\r\nHDFC Bank expects to grow loans faster than the banking sector during the financial year to March 2016, Paresh Sukthankar, deputy managing director at the lender, told reporters.\r\nHe expected the banking system loan growth this fiscal year to be between 13 and 14 percent if the economy grows one percentage point faster. Bank loans grew about 12 percent last fiscal year.\r\nIndian lenders have been hurt by two straight years of slower economic expansion that led to projects being stalled and corporate balance sheets getting stretched. Demand for loans from companies has yet to pick up, although consumer loans are growing fast.\r\n\"Have we seen a huge pick up on the capex side? The answer is \'no\',\" Sukthankar said, but added that was not a surprise since loan demand revival typically comes with a lag to economic recovery.\r\nHDFC Bank\'s net interest income grew 21.4 percent in the March quarter as advances rose 20.6 percent. Net interest margin was stable at 4.4 percent. Bad loans as a percentage of total loans was at 0.9 percent compared with 1 percent in the third quarter.\r\nShares in HDFC Bank, which is India\'s most-valuable lender with more than $40 billion in market capitalisation, have outperformed bigger rivals such as State Bank of India and ICICI Bank so far this year.\r\nHDFC Bank stock has gained 6.5 percent in 2015, while the bank sector index is down 2.6 percent.\r\n($1 = 63.1800 rupees)',pos

So, clearly, the bank has performed exceedingly well in this quarter as well, though we are still awaiting the kind of expectations that one has with respect to the costs of the ING merger. But, having said that, a lot of analysts would have actually increased their credit costs in terms of the expectations of asset quality of ING getting merged with the bank itself.\" \"With net interests margins (NIM) at 4.3 percent, the kind of credit growth that we are witnessing over the past few quarters and the expectation of asset quality normalising, once the merger synergies start playing out over the next few quarters, that is what gives Kotak the premium valuation that it derives.\" \"Probably in our take, HDFC Bank   is more what we like at this point of time, more to do with what kind of growth prospects that the bank has given out. Asset quality even for HDFC Bank, the gross non-performing assets (NPA) is below one percent and net NPAs below 0.3 percent mark are quite a few strong points that the bank possesses. Also credit growth extremely strong.

Even if you look at the volumes, they are expected to be on the softer side as far as Tata Steel European operations are concerned. However, having said that, the domestic operations would see some amount of an uptick with the Kalinganagar plant expected to start production. I think our estimates for the next two years are 1 million tonne to be added respectively over the next two fiscals.\"  \"I think the EBITDA compression is very evident both in terms of growth slowing down, volumes not meaningfully picking up and realisations remaining soft and that would even stand for its South East Africa Asian operations where the dumping of Chinese steel products, both hot roil and cold roil are probably on the higher side. Having said that, I think in terms of valuations the stock looks attractive but clearly the stock will go through pain points as far as earnings are concerned at least for the next two to three quarters to say the least,\" he added. \"One has to have a huge amount of patience of more than two three years to make serious money out of the stock.

The replacement market has significantly increased for the company like TVS Srichakra which contributes 40-45 percent. The fall in raw material prices has probably aided EBITDA margins and they will continue to do so over the next few quarters.

If you are talking about EBITDA margins because of the fall in both natural rubber as well as synthetic rubber, we expect EBITDA margins to hold up to 15 percent.

In fact if you really see 1 million tonne sales in those 35 days, the press release which has been given by Hero Motocorp, actually those who have been cautious or may be negative views they have all been talking that replacement market or the demand for two wheelers has all exhausted.\" \"Practically everyone is owning two wheeler in the country, so there won\'t be so much demand. However, if you can see 1 million tonne getting sold by one player and you combine all other two wheelers in one category, may be Bajaj Auto must have sold 4 lakh - I am taking 35 days, may be TVS Motors must have sold 3 lakh and then Honda which is again an unlisted player - 1 million that category, 1 million Hero Moto alone, if you can sell 2 million still. Now talk of the discretionary spending and all that, one cannot afford to have the car, at least he will go for two wheeler.\" \"Thirdly, if you really see the kind of Mumbai city, I have not seen people find it more though it is so risky, if you are driving in the car you really pray for them always but if you go into the other cities may be tier I, II, III, I am talking all, earlier we used to say that two wheeler is a vehicle for tier II and tier III cities, I don\'t think that you can really live in tier II, tier III without having a scooter and that too one person one scooter,\" he added. \"In fact I happen to visit so many places may be tier III and tier IV cities in this last one year. So, if you have 5 family members probably you may be having 6 two wheelers. So, this is the kind of demand which we have been seeing. Lastly relative valuations or may be the corrected valuations now which we have been seeing practically of all the stocks, may be Bajaj Auto, may be Hero Motocorp, we have seen the Hero Moto taking a big beating, may be post the numbers and all that, their sales numbers were really very bad for some months in Q2.\" \"So taking all this picture I don\'t think that the demand for two wheelers will really taper down or will go down, you will have replacement market, people will have aspirations, they keep changing the model. The way people change the cellphone, people have started changing the two wheelers also.\" \"I will go first with TVS Motor, then followed by Hero Moto and then third by Bajaj Auto. Bajaj Auto   largely because they have export of about may be 1,50,000 vehicle, sometimes more specially in Nigeria and Sri Lanka. Nigerian government and the behaviour and the abrupt decisions, so those things goes haywire. I am not saying those things will get repeated but you can\'t take a comfort also on both the markets - the Nigerian as well as the Sri Lankan market where they have a strong presence. So, if they would not have had 1,50,000 vehicles getting sold in the export market probably my comfort would have gone more on Bajaj Auto.

In fact there has been a pleasant surprise after the first quarter numbers whether the volume growth was almost down by 7-8 percent.\" \"If you look at year-to-date (YTD) numbers it would be nearly flat. There has been a press release by the company recently where it talked about that they have sold almost one million bikes in this festive season. This is a fairly strong number. Not only that if you look at their second quarter results, they were also fairly good in terms of the profitability and which came not only from the higher gross margin which is the raw material benefit but which also came from, they had a better high realisation which means the product mix is getting better as far as the overall sales is concerned.\" \"If you look at the valuations, they will be closed to what about Rs 150 of earnings per share (EPS) in that way in March 2016 itself which means such a strong franchise with almost 52 percent kind of market share in the domestic motorcycle market and profitable market share available at about 17-18 times the six months forward.\" \"We do expect it to grow in the range of about 15-20 percent compounded for next 2-3 years.

In that the automobiles and in particular, the car sector is what we are very positive on. Two reasons for it – in addition to the fact that interest rates over the next 12-15 months are expected to trend down in India, I think there are two large boosts we are expecting in the consumer discretionary sector. The first one is from January 1, 2016. The Seventh Pay Commissions will come into effect. Tonight we will get to know the exact contours. But the government has hinted that there will be roughly Rs 28,000 crore of increase in the wage bill and the pension bill for the next financial year, that is FY17. And similar increase is on the anvil for the next FY18 onwards. So, that will act as a big booster for all the consumer discretionary stocks in the sectors like cars, consumer durables and in two-wheelers.\" \"The second boost will come from the One Rank-One Pension (OROP) recommendations which basically, the arrears from July 1, 2014 will be paid in four equal half yearly instalments and the expectation is that Rs 8,000-10,000 crore of increased spending, the wage bill or the total outlay on OROP, the government will have to earmark which in turn will benefit 25 lakh, ex-service-men and war-widows.

However, within this range, Rs 2,600 is acting as a strong support and more importantly the daily relative strength index (RSI) oscillator is rebounding repeatedly from the level of Rs 50, which is a clear sign of strength. Hence, we expect sooner or later, this range to be broken out on the higher side. The level of Rs 2,750 is the immediate resistance, which we feel would be broken out in the near-term.\"\r\n',pos

'The US, last week, lifted its 4-decade crude export ban after it was pushed through the House and Senate and signed by the President. As highlighted in our thematic report Shale we refine East!, dated July 17, 2015, an imminent fall in US shale production and a regime shift in US crude export policy will narrow the WTI discount over Brent, structurally shifting the competitive advantage for refining from US (one-fifth of global production) to Asia. WTI has indeed flipped into premium over Brent and refining margins in the US have converged to Singapore benchmarks. We believe export-oriented Reliance Industries (RIL) and upcoming complex refining capacities by IOCL, BPCL and HPCL are extremely competitive globally and will benefit most from this paradigm shift in refining. The ban was first imposed in 1975 as the US was reeling from the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo. Despite it being a net oil importer at ~7mnbbls/d, there was a strong case for lifting of crude export ban, primarily because the increasing barrels of US production over the past 5 years was led by light-sweet shale oil, which was not suitable to be processed by complex US refiners which are better equipped to handle heavy-sour crude. This mismatch necessitated movement of crude oil over longer distances to deliver it to refineries for which it is suited. With the lifting of the ban, 9.2mnbbls/d of US crude and ~490mn bbls of stockpiles are available for export. Abundance of light-sweet shale oil resulted in US benchmark WTI trading at deep discounts versus Brent, resulting in a comparative advantage for WTI-based US refiners. In our thematic report, we had forecasted a trend reversal in WTI-Brent spread as we had anticipated a fall in US shale production and relaxation of crude export restrictions. WTI discount over Brent has indeed narrowed fairly quickly (from USD6.5/bbl in August) to a slight premium over Brent, recently. Closing of WTI-Brent arbitrage will benefit US upstream players including shale and a resultant shift in global refining competitiveness will favour Asia. Since our report, US refining margin has squeezed from ~USD25/bbl to USD10/bbl, while Reuters Singapore refining margin has increased from USD8/bbl to USD10/bbl (refer chart 7). We expect RIL to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of this shift in global refining margins given its scale and complexity. The upcoming complex Indian refining capacities (by IOCL, BPCL   and HPCL   ) are amongst the most competitive globally (26\% lower fixed cost). Moreover, we expect domestic surplus to ease as robust demand will outstrip announced capacities, which bodes well for downstream oil companies.\r\n',pos

'Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan sprang a surprise by asking three state-run oil refiners -- IndianOil,  BPCL   and  HPCL   -- to get ready to set up the largest refining and petrochemicals complex in the public sector before 2017-end in coastal Maharashtra. \"I have just asked the state-run refiners to work on setting up an oil refinery-cum-petchem complex in the public sector in western Maharashtra, which should be largest in the public sector. Though it\'s up to these companies to work out the details, I can assure you that ground-breaking for the proposed project would happen before the end of 2017,\" Pradhan told reporters and refused to share details. Considering the fact that the largest refineries are of 15 MTPA capacity, the proposed one should have higher capacity than the two  IOC   refineries in Paradip and Panipat. The announcement came at an event to dedicate the fourth crude distillation unit of BPCL set up here at an investment of Rs 1,419 crore. When asked for details, such as land and resources for such a huge project considering the skewed finances of IOC, BPCL and HPCL (according to him they have lost a whopping Rs 10,000 crore this year so far on inventory losses alone), he said, \"As the minister, my job is to give broader policy guidance and not look into specifics.\" The largest oil refineries in the public sector are being run by IndianOil in Panipat and Paradip, with an installed capacity of 15 MTPA each, while the country is also home to the world\'s largest single location refinery complex at Jamnagar being run by Reliance Industries. RIL\'s first plant has a capacity of 30 MTPA, while its second unit has an installed capacity of 28 MTPA.  Essar Oil   also operates a 20 MTPA refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat. But the minister spoke more on his grand vision about the proposed petchem complex, saying the plant would be built in such a manner that it will be a global oil and petchem hub. Quoting the International Energy Agency\'s (IEA) projection, which recently pegged the domestic oil demand to rise to 550 MTPA by 2040 from the current 165 MTPA, he asked the state-run oil companies to think big along these projection lines. He also said the ongoing growth in oil demand is driven by Maharashtra, and the state would continue to do so, by adding 1-2 MTPA over the next few years. \"Being the largest growth driver of oil consumption, it is in the interest of the state, which does not have a single large refinery on its long coastline, to house the largest refinery and petchem complex,\" Pradhan said. Thanking Pradhan for his grand plan, state Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who was present at the function, promised every help to realise the dream, saying his government would ensure that the project takes off hasslefree in terms of getting the vast swathe of fertile agrarian land acquired and also the green clearances. \"I would ensure that the proposed mega project gets a hasslefree start in terms of making the land available and in securing the green nod. We would not disappoint you in realising your grand vision for the state,\" Fadnavis said. Coastal Maharashtra is thickly populated, with fertile farm land and a thick concentration of fishermen, who have been very vocal against large projects. The 10,000-MW Jaitapur nuclear plant, approved earlier in the decade by previous Manmohan Singh regime, is strongly being opposed by the fishermen. When asked about why the government is not allowing oil marketers to align retail price of petrol and diesel according to crude prices, Pradhan said the average crude price for oil products currently being sold is USD 50-55 a barrel and not USD 34-35 a barrel, which is the current international price. \"State-run oil companies are making heavy inventory losses as their average crude price is much higher than the present market price. They have lost over Rs 10,000 crore so far this year on inventory losses alone. So how can you accuse them of not reducing the retail prices?,\" Pradhan quipped. The minister, however, admitted that taxes on oil products are too high but was quick to clarify that \"Over 40 percent of the taxes collected by the Centre is given back to the states and more than half of the total levies are slapped by the states. So ask this question to them.\" He also said almost 50 percent of the retail price of petrol is constituted by taxes, which are mostly state levies and over 42 percent of the retail price of diesel is also the tax component. But the Centre can\'t do much as states\' levies are much higher than the Central levies, he argued. Pradhan also claimed that the oil companies had reduced Rs 13/L in retail prices of diesel and petrol, in 17 and 20 fortnightly reductions, respectively. But this flies in the face of facts, as diesel prices have come down only by Rs 11/L and petrol by Rs 9/L, while the the Centre has jacked up Excise duty on them four times to the tune of Rs 7.5/L in the past 18 months.\r\n',pos

'Oil prices (Brent) touched $30.72 a barrel after the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on December 04, 2015 to try to figure what, if anything can be done to prop those prices up. OPEC set aside its output target of 30 million barrels a day. Saudi Arabia, the world\'s largest crude exporter, has led the group in fighting for market share against higher-cost producers such as shale drillers in the US. The immediate result is that key petroleum products like gasoline, jet fuel and home heating oil will likely be the cheapest in years heading into the holidays and the cold of winter. Dubai Fateh traded at $25.5/barrel, Brent at $30.72/barrel and WTI at $30.66/barrel at the start of CY16. Crude oil prices (Brent) slumped 38.6\% during the period Dec14-Dec15 because of oversupply caused by rising US shale gas production, slump in manufacturing activity in China, continuous financial problems in Europe and steady production from OPEC countries. The US recorded the largest increase in oil production in the world, becoming the first country ever to increase average annual production by at least 1 million barrels per day for three consecutive years. The US replaced Saudi Arabia as the world’s largest oil producer. US oil production increased 48.1\% from 2012-2015 (7.8 mmbl/d to 11.6 mmbl/d). The growth in US shale gas in recent years has been just as startling, with the US overtaking Russia as the world’s largest producer of oil and gas.

Outlook on Indian OMC’s companies We remain positive on Indian OMC’s like IOCL , BPCL   , HPCL   in the light of diesel de regulation, new short term subsidy sharing formula and positive product cracks. We are also positive on standalone refiners like Chennai Petro   and MRPL   . We believe crash in crude prices and steady demand for petroleum products will benefit Indian refining companies this quarter. We expect Reliance Industries to post record GRM’s in Q3FY16. We are seeing paradigm shift in Indian refining space as PSU refineries are slowly upgrading their refineries and increasing their complexity.

If you look at refining margins considering the fact that the demand for auto fuel has been growing in this part of the world very strongly in the last several months. The refining margins have also been on the uptick.\" \"So, as far as downstream companies are concerned, both retailing segment and refining segment has been doing well, and we are pretty confident about the fact that the reforms that the government has initiated as far as petrol and diesel prices are concerned will continue.

Petrol will cost Rs 60.48 per litre from mid-night tonight in Delhi as against Rs 61.06 (rpt) 61.06 a litre currently. A litre of diesel will cost Rs 46.55 from tomorrow compared with the Rs 46.80 now, said Indian Oil Corporation   (IOC), the nation\'s biggest fuel retailer. The price cut more than reverses the hike of 36 paise a litre in petrol rates effected on November 16, the first increase in five months. Similarly, in the case of diesel, it reverses the three rounds of hikes since October -- the last being 87 paise a litre on November 16. \"The current level of international product prices of petrol and diesel and rupee-dollar exchange rate warrants a decrease in prices, the impact of which is being passed on to consumers with this price revision,\" IOC said in a statement here. Prior to the November 16 hike, petrol price had been slashed on four occasions -- by Rs 2.43 on August 1, Rs 1.27 on August 16, Rs 2 on September 1 and 50 paise on November 1. Diesel rates were not changed on November 1, but hiked by 95 paise on October 16 and 50 paise on October 1. Rates of diesel were last cut by 50 paise on September 1.

'Fitch Ratings on Monday said low oil rates and price deregulation in the country\'s oil and gas sector will have a positive impact on the rated companies in the sector, especially the oil refining and marketing firms. Upstream companies like ONGC   will benefit from having to offer lower discount on crude oil they sell to refiners following greater clarity on the fuel subsidy-sharing formula. \"These changes will also minimise the negative impact on their cash generation from lower oil and gas prices\", Fitch said in a report. Fitch expects refining margins to narrow from January-June levels this year, although margins will remain \"relatively robust in 2016.\" \"We also expect a high level of volatility in crude-oil prices, exposing refiners to inventory gains and losses during 2016\", it said. The sector outlook for Indian oil and gas entities is negative in 2016. \"The benefits from the price reforms and lower global oil prices for refining and marketing companies will be offset by their large capex needs in the medium term, which will lead to negative free cash flows. However, the rating outlooks for 2016 are stable\", it added. Fitch said low crude-oil prices and diesel price deregulation would be positive for marketing firms Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) as that would trim their under-recoveries on subsidised fuels, working capital and related debt requirements. Lower discount requirements on the two state-owned exploration and production firms Oil India Ltd and Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) would benefit their financial profiles. \"There is also greater clarity on the subsidy-sharing arrangement between the state and the two upstream producers concerning kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). These changes have minimised the impact on the upstream producers\' cash generation from lower oil and gas prices\", Fitch said. It said benchmark Brent oil price may stay at USD 55 per barrel for one more year. \"Domestic natural gas prices will be lower in 2016 based on the government\'s pricing formula, which links domestic gas prices to several international gas reference prices,\" it said. India has however proposed in October 2015 to relax natural gas price controls for new fields to incentivise exploration and production activities.\r\n',pos

'Public sector oil firms IOC   , BPCL   , HPCL   and EIL will invest Rs 1.5 lakh crore in setting India\'s biggest refinery on the west coast, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said. Indian Oil Corp, the nation\'s biggest refiner, will build a 60-million tonne a year oil refinery in Maharashtra along with Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) and Engineers India Ltd (EIL), Pradhan said in a twitter post. \"Refinery to be built in 2 phases (40+20 million tonnes); 1st phase will have more than Rs 1 lakh crore investment (biggest in India),\" he said. IOC has been looking at west coast for a refinery as catering to customers in West and South was difficult with its refineries mostly in the North. HPCL and BPCL have also been looking at a bigger refinery because of constraints they face at their Mumbai units. \"The refinery will produce petrol, diesel, LPG, ATF and feedstock for petrochemical plants in plastic, chemical and textile industries in Maharashtra,\" said Pradhan, who discussed the setting up of the refinery with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in Mumbai yesterday. \"Govt of Maharashtra and Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas will closely work for early identification of land for refinery and finalisation of details of project,\" he added. Fifteen million tonnes a year is the biggest refinery any public sector unit has set up in one stage. IOC recently started its 15 million tonnes unit at Paradip in Odisha. Reliance Industries   holds the distinction of building the biggest refinery in India till now. It built its first refinery at Jamnagar in Gujarat with a capacity of 27 million tonnes, which was subsequently expanded to 33 million tonnes. It has built another unit adjacent to it for exports, with a capacity of 29 million tonnes. The refinery being planned by the state-owned firms will be bigger than that. The phase-1 itself will be bigger than any one single unit. It will cost Rs 2,500 crore per million tonnes and for the full 60 million tonnes it will cost Rs 1.5 lakh crore. It will also be accompanied by a petrochemical complex. Being on the west coast will provide the unit a natural advantage of easily sourcing crude oil from the Middle-East and Africa, officials said. Also, moving products to consumption heartland will not be difficult. IOC has six refineries with a total capacity of 54.20 million tonnes. It also has subsidiary refineries with 11.50 million tonnes capacity. Paradip has taken its refining capacity to 80.7 million tonnes. \r\n',pos

'State-owned refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) and gas utility GAIL   India Ltd are looking at jointly setting up a multi-billion dollar petrochemical plant in Andhra Pradesh. They are exploring the possibility of a petrochem project after their plans to team up with France\'s Total, Lakshmi N Mittal Group and Oil India   Ltd (OIL) for a 15 million tons a year refinery-cum-petrochemical plant at Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh fell through. \"That project fell as partners pulled out one after the other due to weak global demand,\" a top official said. \"Now, HPCL and GAIL are looking at setting up a petrochemical plant at the Petroleum, Chemical and Petrochemicals Investment Region (PCPIR) sites identified by the state government.\" GAIL, the official said, is taking a lead in doing the feasibility studies as well as site selections. Cost, capacity and equity structure of the project will be decided after the studies are completed. GAIL is taking a lead in the project as it has expertise in building and operating a gas-based petrochemical plant, the official said. HPCL owns a 6.5 million tonne refinery at Mumbai and a 8.3 million tonne unit at Vizag. While the Vizag plant is being expanded to 15 million tonnes, HPCL is also setting up a 9 million tonnes refinery at Barmer in Rajasthan at the cost of Rs 37,320 crore. The official said HPCL has got land for expanding the Vizag refinery to 15 million tonne and the project will be completed by 2017. HPCL had in 2007-08 planned an only-for-exports refinery to target demand in South East Asia and the Middle East. The five-way alliance of HPCL, explorer OIL, gas utility GAIL India, Mittal Investment Sarl and Total had in October 2007 signed a memorandum of understanding to look at the feasibility of setting up the Vizag project. In 2009, the Rs 50,000 crore project was put on hold as petrochemical demand then was seen as too weak to justify the investment. Total did pre-feasibility for the refinery project and demand studies, while GAIL was in charge of the study of the petrochemical unit. But the project was in 2010 put on back burner before equity structure could be decided. While the refinery was to be built to process sour and heavy crudes, which are cheaper than low-sulphur sweat crude oil, the petrochemical plant was to use the naphtha produced in the refinery as feedstock. The petrochemical plant being talked about now will use natural gas as a feedstock, the official said. \r\n',pos

The management has indicated specifically in terms of couple of assets probably being little a bit soft in the quarter to come. So the restructured asset book probably looks little bit softer for SBI but with capital adequacy remaining strong, SBI becomes a hold.\" He further added, \"In UCO Bank   , the asset quality did disappoint, so on the gross non-performing assets (GNPA) the asset ratio came in at 8.51. If you look at the net asset ratio, it came in at 5.15 compared to 3.15; the profit was aided by treasury gains. So if you look at the greater perspective for UCO Bank, we are still looking at Rs 10,800 crore worth of exposure towards the Discoms and the there is a big question mark on the kind of bailout package that the governments will offer.\" \"So as an alternate the investor can look at ICICI Bank   from the private banking space, it has strong current account savings account (CASA) ratio at 45 percent, you have got capital adequacy tier one specifically withstands at 12.6, the 4,050 odd branches will hold up in good stead as far as their non interest income is concerned and again operating leverage benefits will kick in as retail advances grow at a much faster clip compared to the banking industry. If you take aside the value of subsidiaries that ICICI Bank is deriving around Rs 58 a share, you are probably looking at a bank getting valued at around 1.6-1.7 time price to adjusted book which is reasonable.

'Jet Airways to move Bombay HC for shareholders meet on merger Market regulator Sebi has already approved the merger of JetLite into Jet Airways late last year, airline sources said today.\r\nNaresh Goyal-promoted private carrier Jet Airways   is likely to soon move the Bombay High Court to seek approval for convening shareholders meet on the merger of its subsidiary JetLite with the parent company. Market regulator Sebi has already approved the merger of JetLite into Jet Airways late last year, airline sources said today. Jet Airways had bought Sahara Airlines in April 2007 for Rs 1,450 crore after an arbitration award. It later renamed Sahara Airlines as JetLite and operated it as a low-cost arm till November 2014. The merger is expected to be completed this fiscal. \"Sebi (Security Exchange Board of India) has given its go ahead to the merger late last year. We are now contemplating to approach the Bombay High Court, asking it to allow us convene shareholders meet and take their approval to the merger,\" sources said on condition of anonymity. Jet Airways is likely to move the court in this regard next week, they said. Jet Airways spokesperson was not available for comments. The Jet Airways board had in September last year approved a proposal to make JetLite a business division of the parent company for better synergy and efficiency in operations besides cost savings by way of merger. At the beginning of 2014-15, Jet Airways had announced a three-year turnaround plan to return to profitability. The plan included various standalone measures and synergies with its strategic investment partner, Etihad Airways. At present Jet Airways and JetLite operate under two different Air Operator Permit (AOP). Jet Airways has currently 98 aircraft in its fleet while JetLite has eight, according to the DGCA data. In November, the combined market share of Jet Airways and JetLite stood at 21.3 per cent, the second largest after low-cost carrier IndiGo, which corned 35.5 per cent during the month. The Mumbai-based airline, in which Etihad holds 24 per cent stake, has reported profit for the two consecutive quarters (April-June and July-September) this fiscal. Jet Airways had posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 83 crore in second quarter of the current fiscal against a net loss of Rs 42.8 crore a year-ago period.   \r\n',pos

'Buy Jet Airways; target of Rs 790:is bullish on Jet Airways and has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 790 in its research report dated November 24, 2015.\r\nThe recent sharp fall in ATF prices (down over ~43\% from peak of FY14) has provided significant room for margin expansion along with growth opportunities for the airline Industry. The Indian air travel market is highly under penetrated despite liberalising actions of the Government of India. India’s penetration of 80 per 1000 population is low relative to other developing markets such as Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia and China, where penetration rates are between 350/1000 and 650/1000, respectively. Considering these earnings growth levers, we expect Jet Airways to gain market share along with improved profitability in the next few years. Assuming the benefit of lower ATF prices, we expect EBITDA margin to scale up to 11.3\% (vs. our previous estimate: 9.3\%) as seen in FY11 from 1\% in FY15. We continue to maintain BUY on the stock with a revised target price of | 790/share (i.e. at 6x FY17E EV/EBITDA, 0.7 EV/sales). Given improving macro factors like healthy industry passenger traffic growth (up 19.7\% YoY) coupled with lowest ATF prices, we expect the company to report healthy revenue growth along with better margins during FY15-17E. Hence, we remain positive on the company and maintain our BUY rating with a revised target price of | 790/share (i.e. valuing at 0.7x FY17E EV/sales, 6.5x EV/EBITDA).\r\n\r\n',pos

However, this company has a strong presence and cater to the northern part and we know that cooker is now an essential item. This company has been doing quite well and if you see the first half performance, it has all been constant; topline at about Rs 245 crore but operating profit in the first half has been at Rs 31 crore against Rs 47 crore for whole of FY15. It means operating profit has risen and the earnings per share (EPS) for FY\'15 was at Rs 60 while H1 EPS is at Rs 40.\" \"If you see the financial performance for FY\'14, the company had an EPS of Rs 72 and then it fell to Rs 60 in FY\'15 but going by the H1 trend where EPS has been shown at Rs 40, I am at least confident that they are moving back to the trajectory of EPS as closer to about Rs 60. Because of this fall in the EPS or maybe the flat working company posted, the share has corrected from Rs 4,600 in February 2015 to Rs 2,200. In fact people should not get surprise that this is a bonus effect. Nothing like that; this is just an erosion in the price to the extent of Rs 2,400 in the share price and now it has reached the bottom and the best part is that of Rs 60 EPS, the company has dividend payout of 90 percent. The dividend was 450 percent for FY\'15. It means they paid dividend of Rs 45,\" he said. \"If you add the dividend distribution tax which works out to about Rs 8-9, Rs 53-54 has been paid to the shareholder out of the EPS of Rs 60 and this dividend payout policy is consistent of 85 percent to 90 percent. So I am expecting that if the EPS is seen at about Rs 55-60 for this year, the dividend payout also will be very high and maybe the current year will have a dividend of 500 percent and apart from that it is a debt free company, promoter\'s stake of 56 percent and equity is low at Rs 5.3 crore with a face value of Rs 10.

They definitely hold their earnings potential in good stead but having said that if you look at the trailing valuations, Sun Pharma   and Aurobindo Pharma   are something that we still believe have some headroom left in terms of price action. Clearly for Sun Pharma FY\'16 will be a washout here and what probably happens beyond that with the resolutions in Halol, EBITDA margins probably getting back to normal, RoEs getting back to normal and that will hold Sun Pharma in good stead from an FY17 perspective.\" \"For Aurobindo Pharma, our take is that the injectibles business is a huge business. The management themselves expect 18-20 approvals to come through over the next couple of years. Higher margins business and the kind of acquisitions that they have done specifically with activists in that role should help them in posting a topline over the next two years close to Rs 16,000-16,500 crore odd,\" he said. \"Clearly Aurobindo Pharma and Sun Pharma remain our preferred picks.

'6 stocks likely to see lot of action today \r\n\r\nThe first stock pick today is Maruti Suzuki   . This is a very good stock not only from short-term perspective but investment positions can be created in this stock. For now, one can buy Maruti with a stoploss of Rs 4,600 on the downside and the target on upside can be expected at Rs 4,950. We are giving a sell recommendation on the pharmaceutical stock, which is Lupin   . We think that pharmaceutical is going to underperform over the next few weeks as well and one can sell Lupin with a stoploss of Rs 1,885 on upside and the target can be expected near Rs 1,680 on the downside.\r\n\r\nI would recommend Tata Motors DVR today. This stock has staged a smart breakout on daily charts and it is likely to do well now. For the day, my target will be Rs 284 and Rs 287, please maintain a stoploss below Rs 272. Second stock would be Hindalco Industries   . After good numbers, this stock is likely to do well. I am expecting a pullback in this stock, maintain a stoploss below Rs 78 and target for the day would be Rs 83-84.\r\n\r\n',pos
'Pick Maruti Suzuki on dips \r\none may pick Maruti Suzuki on dips. \r\n\"This morning there was a lot of positivity that Maruti Suzuki   is a stock to buy on dips. However, it is not that easy. My whole idea is that most of the auto stocks look very positive from a long term standpoint and I am specifically referring to four wheelers here. Maruti too I would say looks a promising story. However, would I invest in it? I would not invest in it immediately at these levels, I don\'t see a huge percentile return with a 6-8 month horizon.

'Prefer Maruti Suzuki\r\nis of the view that one may prefer Maruti Suzuki and Tata Motors.\r\n\"I am a buyer of Maruti Suzuki   and four wheelers. I think the story for Maruti does continue and the premiumisation that Maruti gets is justified. Decent market share, again I think the kind of product mix that Maruti has got is very encouraging. The kind of new launches it has got, Baleno is extremely well received by the markets and clearly if you look at the fall in raw material costs, the margins that one expects Maruti to post should be sustained. So, clearly I think the kind of earnings that Maruti is expected to derive close to that Rs 225 odd mark, we are expecting that to sustain. So, clearly Maruti is something that we clearly like.\" He further added, \" Tata Motors   is something that we still recommend long-term investors to probably have a look at. With the exciting new launches coming through for Tata Motors specifically on the passenger vehicle (PV) side and with jaguar Land Rover (JLR) expected to probably post better numbers going forward, the Chinese numbers which are expected to be muted in single digits probably are well discounted and factored in by the markets. So, four wheeler stocks specifically Maruti Suzuki and Tata Motors is what we like at the current juncture.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',pos

I don\'t think that they will be losing the market share. They are continuously improving their performance. Overall the leadership and supremacy will be maintained by Maruti and I am impressed with the numbers. In fact the Gujarat plant news about a year back made the stock to correct at around Rs 2000 and at that time also I was taking the positive view.

So, overall I am quite impressed with the number and continue to have a positive view.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n',pos
'Maruti working on equipping all cars with safety features Currently, auto-manufacturers introduce safety features only in middle and top variants of some existing models. \r\n\r\nCountry\'s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki   is working on introducing safety features in all variants of its cars, both existing and new, a company official said today. Currently, auto-manufacturers introduce safety features only in middle and top variants of some existing models. \"We are working on making safety features as standard feature in all existing products of ours. We are planning to introduce a model fitted with safety features ahead of the government\'s regulation,\" Maruti Suzuki India Executive Director (Marketing and Sales) R S Kalsi told reporters. He was here to launch the premium hatchback \'Baleno\', which would be a global car made from India. \"Baleno comes with all the safety features like dual air bags and ABS as standard features in all its variants,\" he said. The car would be available from the exclusive Nexa outlets set up by the automaker, along with S-Cross, he said. Maruti Suzuki currently has 80 Nexa outlets across the country and would take it to 100 by year-end. Baleno will be available in four petrol and three diesel variants at an introductory price of Rs 5.16 lakh for the basic petrol variant, while the top-end diesel model is priced at Rs 8.34 lakh (ex-showroom Chennai).\r\n',pos

I think the regulators and the government will have to take note of it, especially in light of the issues plaguing the climate change.\" \"I believe that it is the petrol vehicles that will be preferred by many agencies and hence Maruti Suzuki   , which figures amongst our top picks, is a stock which has a far bigger portfolio of petrol cars stands to benefit the most in case the NGT order were to be implemented and this will only be a cue to other metros and mini-metros where the problem of pollution is equally acute,\" he added. \"So, what stops for example a city like Mumbai or Ahmedabad or any other city to also go down the same route? It is only a matter of time and that is why I believe that those companies that have a very large portfolio of petrol cars and petrol passenger vehicles or commercial vehicles, they are the ones that one should be looking at in the medium-term.

'Good response for Baleno, could aid market share: \r\n said the company is committed to double-digit growth in FY16. \r\nRS Kalsi, Executive Director-Marketing & Sales, Maruti is happy with the response Baleno is drawing but said it would not be appropriate to talk on the sales in number terms yet. When asked if he saw uptick in the market share from the current 47.6 percent that the company holds, he said market shares are basically determined by what the competition does; adding that introduction of this premium hatchback could add to the momentum and may enhance the market share. He said the company is committed to double-digit growth in FY16. For the first half Maruti clocked a growth of 12.7 percent, which could be replicated in second half too, he added. Baleno is set to compete with Hyundai\'s Elite i20 and Honda\'s Jazz and will have a 1.2litre petrol engine (manual and automatic variants) and 1.3-litre diesel engine.  Baleno has been developed for the global markets and India will be the exclusive manufacturing hub for the car. He was not overly worried about the lack of response to the premium sedan S-Cross, stating that the sales were in line with company plans and in two months they had sold about 10000 cars. It is important to look at sales of any car from a six month perspective, he added The company is not offering any major discounts apart from the basic Rs 20000 on S-Cross. Suzuki which controls 56\% stake in Maruti, has decided to make India a global manufacturing hub for its upcoming premium compact car `Baleno\', which will be exported to over 100 countries, including the Western European nations. This will be the first instance of Maruti - which contributes 40\% to Suzuki\'s global sales volume and one third to its revenues -supplying a car to its parent for and manufacturing teams of the company see this as a \"big achievement\".

'Super Six stocks you can bet on September 18 \r\n\r\nJay Thakkar of Sharekhan is of the view that one may buy Canara Bank with a target of Rs 280. \r\n\r\nOn CNBC-TV18\'s show Super Six, market gurus Jay Thakkar, Meghana V Malkan and Ashish Kyal, place their bets on two stocks each, thus offering investors a variety of options to choose from. Investors can read into the detailed analysis before agreeing to any or all the bets. Jay Thakkar of Sharekhan The first buy recommendation is on Canara Bank   . One can buy this stock for the retracement of its entire fall which has been a five-wave declining structure. So what we are expecting is a three-wave rise, one can buy this stock for a three-wave rise on the upside. The minimum retracement target comes to Rs 280 whereas the stoploss can be placed at Rs 261. The momentum indicators are well in the buy mode with the stock trading above its short-term average. These technical evidences clearly suggest that the stock is heading towards the level of Rs 280. The second buy call is on Reliance Industries   . It has formed a kind of a double bottom and from those levels, we have seen the stock forming higher tops and higher bottoms on a daily charts. One can buy at a current market price for a target of Rs 915 with a stoploss of Rs 855. Meghana V Malkan of malkansview.com My first pick is a buy call on Bajaj Auto   , Rs 2,300 was the previous resistance from the stock which has become a good support. It also formed a bullish candle pattern in Wednesday\'s trading session with good volumes at that level. Therefore a buy call on Bajaj Auto for a stoploss of Rs 2,300 for a target of Rs 2,440. My second call is a sell call on Zee Entertainment Enterprises   . It has been resisting crossing Rs 400 levels since the past three-four trading sessions forming indecisive candle patterns at that level. Therefore a sell call on Zee with a stoploss of Rs 400 for a target of Rs 377. Ashish Kyal of wavesstrategy.com Welspun India   is one of the stocks which has been continued to move higher despite of an independent to the Indian equity movement. So it can be bought with a stoploss of Rs 790 and the target of somewhere around Rs 935 can be expected. This stock has made a high near Rs 960 and retraced somewhere around 38.2 percent of the entire rise and from there we have seen a smart recovery and a good bounce back which has taken a good support near 100 days moving average (DMA). Next stock which we are recommending is a sell call on Bharat Forge   . We have suggested sell just a few days back and again this stock has continued to move lower as expected. It has been failing to cross above 20 days moving average and has been constantly forming lower high and lower lows. So as long the structure remains intact, it should be a sell on rally strategy. So this stock is definitely in the downward zone and one should avoid catching a low in this stock. The target on the downside can be expected somewhere around Rs 880 and the stoploss should be maintained at Rs 990.\r\n\r\n',pos

'U-turn on payments bks: SBI head sees \'opportunity\' for all \r\n\r\nLast week, the RBI had given in-principle approval to 11 entities, such as Reliance, Airtel, Vodafone, Birla Group, Mahindra, among others, to set up payment banks. On two occasions, Bhattacharya had raised concerns over the entry of payments banks and said these entities could eat into the share of the existing banks.\r\n\r\nIn a U-turn from her earlier stated position on the entry of payments banks, SBI   chief Arundhati Bhattacharya on Tuesday said there is nothing negative about them and there is a huge opportunity for the entire banking system. \"I want to very clearly say that there is nothing to be negative about the payments banks. Because whenever you have challenge, the other side of the coin is an opportunity. And I think if we don\'t realise it then nobody else would do so,\" Bhattacharya said at the annual bankers summit Fibac here this evening. \"With this new competition, I think there is a huge opportunity out there for the entire banking sector. And this opportunity is for us to take,\" she said. Last week, the RBI had given in-principle approval to 11 entities, such as Reliance   , Airtel , Vodafone, Birla Group, Mahindra, among others, to set up payment banks. On two occasions, Bhattacharya had raised concerns over the entry of payments banks and said these entities could eat into the share of the existing banks. It would be a dog-eat-dog market if the deep-pocket corporates, which have bagged the payments bank licences, unleash a rate war, she said at the same event yesterday. Earlier in the day, SBI Research, in a note, has said the 11 payments banks can free up assets worth Rs 14 trillion for the infra sector alone annually. Last week, a day after the RBI issued the licences, she told Governor Raghuram Rajan that these new players would disrupt the universal banks with their technical agility. She had said these banks would be coming in without any risk, they would be coming in with an agile system and delivery models and that they have not been held hostage by industry-level agreements and wage limits. Reeling off a few data points about the high level of cash and lower retail to GDP ratio in India as against Southeast Asia, she said the banking sector has enough opportunities.\r\n\r\n',pos

Augur Overseas Operation is a wholly owned subsidiary of Augur Aeronautical Centre (AAC), a leading aerostat and airship designer, builder and supplier globally. Augur Aeronautical Centre has already tied up with Pipavav Defence   , a company acquired by Reliance Group. \"This is part of strategic technical partnership to collaborate on new technologies both for the civil and military market as part of \'Make in India\' policy,\" a statement by the Reliance Group said. Under the agreement, the two companies will form a joint venture company, with Reliance controlling 51 per cent stake, consistent with the current Government regulations. The joint venture (JV) will be involved in development, production, sales, modification and life support for different sizes of aerostats, airships and lighter than air systems. This JV will address the requirements of domestic market and also the regional and global markets. As part of the existing arrangement, the first medium size Aerostat envelope was delivered recently, the statement said. This was after successful acceptance tests were performed at Pipavav facilities. The tests included integration and simulated mooring; verification of equipment and functioning of Aerostat envelope together with pressurisation system. In the present changing security scenario in the Indian context, there is a constant need of monitoring as the country has almost 14,000 km long international border, including a nearly 7,500 km coast line. Aerostat radars are a force multiplier as they are deployed extensively in the surveillance, reconnaissance and communication roles by the armed forces. These are also useful in detecting low-flying fighter aircraft. As per the latest market research report, the aerostat market is projected to rise from Rs 25,000 crore in 2014 to Rs 65,000 crore by 2020, the statement said.\r\n\r\n',pos

'Buy Reliance Industries on declines: Mayuresh Joshi \r\n\r\nMayuresh Joshi of Angel Broking recommends buying Reliance Industries on declines with a long term view.\r\n\r\nMayuresh Joshi of Angel Broking told CNBC-TV18, \"We have been extremely optimistic on Reliance Industries    even at lower levels. Though it might underperform, if you leave aside this quarter which is expected to better with GRMs probably inching up, clearly I think from an FY16 perspective the stock might not perform in terms of expectations because the core business, capex to probably show returns will take FY17. Even I think the non-core capex that they have probably done in their different business verticals, I think for that to probably show traction will take the same amount of time period.\" \"However, from a portfolio pick, from a long term investor\'s pick this is a must have stock on your list. So, any decline that you probably see on the stock becomes a very good buying opportunity. We remain optimistic on Reliance from a long term perspective,\" he said.\r\n\r\n',pos

'Telecom firms gear up for deals as competition heats up\r\n\r\nWith about 980 million wireless users, India\'s mobile market trails only that of China.\r\n\r\nIndia\'s crowded telecoms sector is preparing for a long-awaited shake-up as highly indebted players jostle for access to costly airwaves and brace for the launch of a deep-pocketed new rival backed by India\'s richest man, Mukesh Ambani. Ambani owns oil-to-retail conglomerate Reliance Industries, which is expected to begin offering fast data services across India by early 2016. With about 980 million wireless users, India\'s mobile market trails only that of China. But despite impressive growth rates, many firms are struggling with balance sheets stretched by costly spectrum auctions and rock bottom tariffs, making the telecoms sector in India prime for mergers and consolidations. In the first such move in seven years, Reliance Communications   (RCom), owned by Ambani\'s younger brother and rival Anil, has agreed to buy Russian group Sistema\'s Indian mobile phone business. \"One thing is clear: India has too many players and too much regulation in this space. Not everybody can make a profitable business out of it on a sustainable basis,\" said a telecoms and technology M&A banker with a leading U.S. bank. \"The dealmaking conditions were ripe for many years, but the push is now coming from Reliance\'s entry into the sector,\" he said. \"There will be a few more deals happening over the next couple of years, and some (players) will fall by the wayside.\" The arrival of Reliance Industries   into the sector, under the brand name Jio, will further squeeze players such as RCom and Bharti Airtel   . Bankers expect smaller players to be pushed into the arms of larger rivals, bulking up to battle Reliance\'s Jio. Currently most carriers operate on wafer-thin margins, with 8 of the dozen carriers, including Aircel -- a unit of Malaysia\'s Maxis Communications Bhd -- and Tata Teleservices, holding a market share of less than 10 percent, according to sector regulator TRAI. Players including Aircel, which owns coveted 3G and 4G spectrum, could be a likely buyout target, analysts and bankers said, in a market overshadowed by large players including Bharti Airtel and the Indian unit of Vodafone. Aircel did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Tata Teleservices, the seventh-biggest mobile operator, is, according to sources, looking for a buyer for the stake Japan\'s NTT DoCoMo owns in the joint venture. DoCoMo decided to pull out last year, as the JV did not meet performance targets. RCom\'s Monday deal gave it access to more high-speed fourth-generation spectrum that Sistema owned, critical at a time when there is a huge demand for quality and fast data connection as more Indians access the Internet through their smartphones. Others will follow suit, bankers and analysts said. \"The industry world over has three to five major players. India has to follow that,\" said Hemant Joshi, a partner at consultancy Deloitte in India.\r\n',pos

He added, \"This is an engagement which the Jio will be looking at across the sections of the society and I hope in two years we can look back at the achievement of Punjab (wherein) farmers, traders they can become role model for the rest of the country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',pos

This stock has managed to trade at the 52-week high when majority of the market has been drifting lower. So, despite the negative sentiments across the board, this stock has bucked the trend and has continued to move higher. One can buy it at current market price, keep a stoploss at Rs 234 and target can be expected at Rs 260. The next stock will be sell on Adani Ports   . If you check, the stock has continued to drift lower irrespective of the movement of the majority of the market.

Daily chart of the stock shows a three wave correction which has unfolded in a channelized manner. In the last session, the stock has taken support near lower end of the channel. So, here on the stock can attempt a decent bounce and can test its upper channel line which is close to Rs 396 and stoploss can be placed Rs 363.

'Sun Pharma may rally as Taro not to invest in wind energy\r\nShares of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries   are likely to see relief rally on Thursday after its subsidiary has decided not to invest in wind energy business in the US. US subsidiary Taro Pharma in its annual general meeting notice has said it has withdrawn proposal worth USD 225 million to invest in wind energy business. \"Some of the company\'s subsidiaries were contemplating an investment in a wind energy project in the US. Subsequent to a further evaluation, these subsidiaries have decided not to proceed with this potential project,\" the company says in its filing to the exchange. Taro Pharmaceuticals, on November 17, had proposed a USD 275 million investment in the construction of & acquisition of a wind-powered electric energy project jointly with affiliates of company\'s controlling shareholder, Sun Pharma in US. It was with equity investment of USD 100 million (Sun Pharma and Taro to invest in a ratio of 2:1), with the balance being funded through debt. Reason behind Sun and Taro\'s investment in wind energy was to reduce tax liability as renewable energy projects in the US are eligible for tax breaks under Federal Production Tax Credit (PTC) as well as achieve accelerated tax depreciation. Credit Suisse (in its note on November 19) had said total cost of the project for Sun Pharma was expected to be USD 250 million and tax savings from this deal was expected to be USD 25 million annually. Additionally, the company was expected to receive lifetime tax benefits of USD 175 million. The stock has corrected more than 6 percent in last four consecutive sessions and fell more than 20 percent in November due to regulatory concerns at Halol, potential non-strategic investment in wind power project and lack of disclosure around the USD 400 million deal with a third party. Analysts, which were worried due to company\'s investment in unrelated business and raised questions over capital allocation decision, feels the company\'s current decision not to proceed with wind power project in the US is a positive development and valuations are attractive. According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (which has maintained buy rating on the stock and target price of Rs 1,070), the street is factoring in worst outcome at Halol plant (import alert), which is reflected in current valuations (trading 20 percent below long-term average). It believes risk-reward is favourable and current valuations present a particularly attractive buying opportunity. Conceptually, the brokerage continues to like Sun Pharma\'s best-in-class franchise, strong execution track record, evolving specialty business and ability to generate free cash flow. It feels Gleevec launch is the next key catalyst for stock.\r\n',pos

'Super Six stocks you can bet on October 5\r\n\r\nThe first is Larsen and Toubro (L&T). This stock has fallen in a five wave declining structure which is quite visible on the weekly charts. On the monthly chart, it has been a straight fall. However, at least for a very short-term, for say two or three days or within this week, I see this stock inching towards the levels of Rs 1,570. This is a very conservative target of the inverse head and shoulder pattern from which it has given a breakout and that is quite visible on the hourly charts. On the lower side Rs 1,470 that is the neckline, support of this inverse head and shoulder pattern; that is a very good support. So, one can buy L&T for a target of Rs 1,570 with a stoploss of Rs 1,470. The second buy recommendation is on Tata Consultancy Services   (TCS). This stock has been consolidating in a triangular pattern since couple of months now. It has just reversed from the lower end of the range and it has completed the wave E of this triangular pattern which happens to be the last wave of any consolidation. So, the way it has also started to form higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily charts, the stock is inching towards the higher end of this trading band. So, the target for TCS comes to Rs 2,720. So, what I recommend is, one can buy TCS for a target of Rs 2,720 with a stoploss of Rs 2,600.\r\nThe first stock that we are looking at it is Welspun India   . This stock has strongly outperformed and as soon as we start seeing some kind of stabilisation, we see that this stock starts outperforming. So, Welspun India can be bought with a stoploss of Rs 810 and the target we can expect around Rs 910. The next stock that we have picked up is Hitachi Home   . The stock has come very close to the 200 day moving average and we are now seeing a higher high, higher low formation. We have seen a good bounce back in past few days and that is why the momentum can be build up on this stock.

Since its launch in November 2014 by Greg Clark, UK Minister for Universities, Science and Cities and Indian Minister for Human Resource Development Smriti Irani, Generation UK-India has received more than 7,000 registrations and with over 2,600 completed applications for the first 500 places. \"As a technology partner to many large British businesses, we see their desire to exploit new and exciting opportunities presented by digital technologies. However, all too often, our customers are unable to do this quickly as the UK talent pool needs knowledge and training in these new technologies,\" TCS Chief Executive Officer and MD N Chandrasekaran said. By providing 1,000 British graduates with the opportunity to work and train with TCS, TCS hopes to help address this skills shortage and give UK employers access to the digital expertise that they will need to compete and succeed in the hyper-connected Digital Economy, he added. TCS has been operating in the UK since 1975 and works with some of the UK\'s biggest businesses including 33 of the FTSE 100.\r\n\r\n',pos

'Tata Steel has received green nod for expansion as well as setting up of two units at its Joda plant in Keonjhar district, Odisha, entailing an investment of over Rs 185 crore. Based on the recommendation of the Expert Appraisal Committee, the Environment Ministry has \"decided to grant environmental clearance to Tata Steel for expansion of Fe-Mn (Ferro Manganese) alloy plant from 0.0504 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) to 0.06 MTPA at Joda\", a senior official said. Besides, it has got go-ahead for addition of 0.06 MTPA silico-manganese plant and 0.05 MTPA manganese sinter plant in existing ferro alloy plant at Joda, Koenjhar district in Odisha, the official added. The total project cost will be about Rs 185.58 crore, providing employment to about 1,500-2,000 people during the construction and for about 156 persons during operations. The approval has been given with some specific conditions including developing green belt in 33 percent of plant area and maintaining of gaseous emissions within permissible limits among others, the official said. The company is expanding the ferro alloys production keeping in view the country\'s rising steel demand, which is expected to touch 193 MT in 2020. Ferro alloy plant at Joda was commissioned in 1957 to cater to the manganese alloy requirements of Tata Steel works at Jamshedpur. Initially, the plant produced both, Fe-Mn and Silico Manganese (Si-Mn). Subsequently, it was decided to produce only Fe-Mn at Joda in 2000. Currently, Tata Steel produces its entire requirement of Fe-Mn from captive plant and sells a part in the market. Tata Steel, largest producer of manganese alloys in India, operates three ferro alloy plants at Joda and Bamnipal in Keonjhar district and one unit at Attgarh, Cuttack district in Odisha.

'Tata Steel    has resumed iron ore production from two of its four mines in Odisha, a move that may help the company overcome raw material shortages which forced it to buy from domestic as well as overseas markets. \"The company has resumed iron ore production from two of its four mines in Odisha after the state government allowed it to operate these,\" said a source privy to the development.  The Odisha government, earlier this week had allowed the steel major to operate its four iron ore mines in the state till January 28 as per an interim order of the Odisha High Court. Earlier, the state government had ordered Tata Steel to stop operations at four mines - Bamebari, Katamati, Joda East and Joda West - after the steel major failed to meet the November 15 deadline for forest and environment clearances. Tata Steel has moved the high court and argued that its mines should not be shut as they were captive ones and suspension of work will lead to unemployment of a large number of workers, mostly tribals. The company\'s six iron ore mines were among the 26 mines  which were asked to suspend mining operations in view of a Supreme Court order on May 16 this year. In its interim order, the apex court had called for suspending operations of 26 iron ore and manganese mines in Odisha that were operating under the provisions of deemed extension. The Supreme Court had held that such mines could not continue operations until the Odisha government passed express orders under relevant laws. The state government issued express order allowing operations till January 28. Facing iron ore crunch for the first time in its over 100 years of history, Tata Steel has now been operating its 9.7 million tonnes per annum facility in Jamshedpur with raw material bought from domestic sources besides imports.    The company, which has bought 2.3 million tonnes iron ore to run its lone steel-making facility in the country, said the quantum of buying would go up if its closed mines do not start production.  \"For the first time in our history, we are running our plant with bought out iron ore as all our mines are closed.

'Tata Steel’s domestic operations have been persistently delivering strong operational performance even though both the domestic as well as international demand scenario has been subdued. The company has managed to raise its steel sales from 6.6mn tons in FY12 to 8.5mn tons in FY14 led by the commissioning of the 2.9mtpa plant in FY14. Going forward, we expect a volume CAGR of 9.8\% led by full utilisation of current capacities and the commissioning of the Kalinganagar plant by the end of FY15. EBIDTA/ton in FY14, which was flat on a yoy basis, is expected to improve due to lower coking coal prices, operational efficiencies, superior product mix and stable steel prices. Led by a combination of higher volumes and expansion in margins, we expect operating profit to jump 45.5\% over FY14-17E.” “Tata Steel has managed to get back on its growth trajectory over the last one year following improved performance in domestic business and a turnaround at operating level in Europe. We believe the turnaround in European operations would gain steam in FY15 led by a revival in European demand, impact of the various cost saving initiatives and subdued raw material prices. Domestic performance is expected to get better with the commissioning of the new plant at Kalinganagar. Domestic margins are expected to increase from current levels due to lower coking coal costs and higher production efficiency. Net debt is expected to decline 11\% over FY14- 17 on account of higher cash flows in India, European operations turning free cash flow positive from FY16, reducing capex intensity and company’s persistent effort to unlock value by selling non-core assets.” “We believe Tata Steel would further witness some re-rating as the European recovery gains momentum. The SC ruling on coal blocks allocated post 1993 would not impact the company’s earnings as mines were allocated prior to 1993. Tata Steel remains our preferred pick in the steel sector on the back of strong performance registered in the last one year and due to the various earnings driver for the company over the next two years.

We believe that this deal would add in the range of Rs20/share in form of lower interest cost and capex; assuming consideration at US$1bn for the transaction.” “Post this deal, entire of Tata steel Europe\'s (TSE) volume would come from Strip products which has better demand outlook compared to Longs. These operations were plagued by high employee cost, low scale and high overhead cost despite series of cost reduction initiatives undertaken by the management over past six years. About 6,500 people are employed at LPE and its distribution facilities which is way ahead of global benchmarks. Given the sluggish outlook for Longs, company took an impairment of £700m in FY13. Book value of the division stands at £350m. Stock has fallen ~16\% in last couple of months for host of concerns like sharp cut in global iron ore prices, regulatory issues on renewal of mines in India and sluggish macro environment in Europe.

'Tata Steel’s topline increased 11\% yoy to Rs364bn; quite higher than our estimate of Rs346bn. The outperformance in topline was largely due to strong increase in steel realisations in Dollar terms in the European subsidiary.

The company has witnessed some inventory buildup during the quarter. Standalone blended realisations were lower than expected due to lower contribution from FAMD division, which was impacted by suspension of operations at Tata Steel’s 2 mines. Production volumes in Europe were marginally lower by 1.1\% qoq to 3.7mn tons. Volumes at its South Asian units remained subdued at 1.07mn tons due to dumping of cheap Chinese steel.” “We believe domestic operations would continue to be the earnings driver for Tata Steel over the next two years.

'Chinese firms are teaming with Indian companies to jointly bid for five high-speed railway projects in India in an apparent attempt to compete with Japan\'s plans to build bullet trains . The Indian government will soon open the projects for public bidding and Tata Projects, one of the fastest growing infrastructure companies in India, is in discussions with an undisclosed Chinese company that owns the advanced technology used in the bid, state-run China Daily reported today. Industry insiders believe the potential partner would be one of China\'s major rail companies, CSR Corp or CNR Corp, though neither company would confirm they were part of the bid, the front page report from Mumbai titled \"Chinese firms eye Indian rail projects\" said. The Daily\'s report came as Japan has announced financial, technical and operational support for bullet train projects in India during the current visit of PM Narendra Modi to Tokyo. China is expected to unveil its investments in India during President Xi Jinping\'s visit to New Delhi, scheduled for the third week of this month. The issue of Chinese investments in Indian railways figured in yesterday\'s talks between Indian Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and her Chinese counterpart Gao Hucheng here. She told media after the talks that India wants Chinese investments and expertise to upgrade the existing tracks to increase the speed of the trains up to about 160 km besides modernising stations. Asked whether India is open for bullet trains from China, she said \"I would not close the door but what exactly it is going to be and will it work out which the railways can work out\". Sitharaman\'s talks with Chinese officials focussed on Chinese investments to be announced by Xi during his visit to India. Vinayak Deshpande, managing director of Tata Projects, said his company has previously cooperated with CSR on a train project in Navi Mumbai. \"We like to use China\'s technology and products because they are proven to be reliable and the cost is relatively low,\" Deshpande was quoted by Daily as saying. He said the Indian government plans to complete the high-speed railway projects in the following five years. \"When the new prime minister, Narendra Modi said India will make great efforts on railway construction and urban infrastructure, it brings big opportunities for Chinese companies,\" Deshpande said. Although Chinese companies face competition from japanese and European counterparts, they have advantages in rich experience and lower cost in the high-speed railway sector, Deshpande said. Feng Hao, a researcher at the Institute of Comprehensive Transportation at the National Development and Reform Commission, said India has been advancing high-speed railway projects to improve transportation, as it is keen to be part of the Bangladesh-India-Myanmar-China economic corridor and to upgrade the service level of its public transportation. \"This indicates that having an efficient and fast railway  network is critical for India to reach all its goals,\" Feng told the Daily. \"China\'s Yunnan province is the gateway to South Asia and  geographically close to West Bangladesh, and has a lot of potential to enhance business cooperation and tourism exchanges with East India,\" Feng said. \"As the China high-speed railway network grows, choosing Chinese technologies and products should be beneficial to a developing nation such as India or Turkey, because it offers competitive prices and timely after-sale services,\" he said.

'Tata Steel    on Wednesday reported a net profit of Rs 337 crore for the quarter ended June as against Rs 1,139 crore year-on-year. Analysts believe the consolidated earnings of the company are pretty much in-line though there is some decline on a standalone basis. According to Tarang Bhanushali of IIFL, the consolidated numbers meet the expectation though there is slight disappointment on the standalone side. There is also a marginal decline in the EBITDA margin but overall there are no major surprises by the steel major. Echoing Bhanushali’s view, senior research analyst Giriraj Daga, Nirmal Bang says the standalone came in lower and the volumes have also declined marginally but overall the earnings are broadly in-line.

'Kolkata, Nov 5 (IANS) Steel major Tata Steel on Thursday posted an increase of near 22 percent in its net profit at Rs.1,529 crore for the quarter ended September 30 this year although its turnover headed southwards by 18 percent.\r\nDuring the same months last year, it reported a net profit of Rs.1,254 crore.\r\nThe turnover for the second quarter of the current fiscal year stood at Rs.29,305 crore as against Rs.35,777 crore in the similar quarter of last fiscal, while deliveries also saw a decline at 6.33 million tonnes in the quarter under review as against 6.50 million tonne in the July-September time period in 2014.\r\nDomestic realisations in India continued to witness increasing pressure.\r\nIn a statement, the company said subdued manufacturing activity in the country adversely affected the underlying domestic steel demand which decreased by 5 percent over the previous quarter. Further, the relatively strong currency exacerbated the problem.\r\nIndia continued to see strong imports from China and other FTA countries like Japan and Korea with net imports rising by over 100 percent over corresponding period last year.\r\nThe company said the market conditions in Europe, primarily in Britain, worsened significantly in the second quarter as Britain continued to witness surge in imports and declining competitiveness of the manufacturing sector.\r\nSoutheast Asian operations continued to witness drop in rebar-scrap spreads and intense pricing pressure on back of imports from China. However, the renewed focus on cost saving initiatives, new markets, downstream sales and exports, led to improved profitability.\r\nThe company has decided to restructure its Chinese operations in Xiamen and consequently have taken a charge of Rs.158 crore during this quarter.\r\n\"Despite the ongoing downturn in global commodity prices and the seasonal weakness in demand, we were able to increase our deliveries by nine percent during the quarter on the back of strong sales to the auto sector and a higher proportion of value added products.\r\n\"This coupled with better operational efficiencies has helped us partially counter the headwinds of increasing imports and lower steel prices,\" said Tata Steel India and Southeast Asia managing director T.V. Narendran in the statement.',pos
'Tata Steel   today said it expects commercial production at its Kalinganagar steel plant in Odisha to begin from April. \"Some units of the plant like coke oven plant, sinter plant have already started production on a trial basis. The blast furnace and steel melting shop will be on trial in the current quarter (Jan-Mar). So we should be able to start commercial production at Kalinganagar plant from April 2016,\" Tata Steel Managing Director T V Narendran said. He was speaking on the sidelines of the inauguration of Indian Iron & Steel Sector Skill Council office at New Town here. With the 3-MT Kalinganagar steel plant\'s first phase, the Tata Steel India\'s total capacity will rise to 13 MT. Narendran said though 2015 was bad for the steel market due to sluggish demand and cheap imports, Tata\'s Jamshedpur plant will end the year with production close to its rated capacity of 10 MT. He said India\'s steel demand is expected to grow by 5-6 per cent in 2016 and the worst seems to be over. \"Last year (2015) was very bad in terms of global steel prices. But I believe steel prices have hit the bottom. Steel prices in 2016-17 will not be as low as in 2015,\" he said. \"I am more positive on demand... We are quite hopeful that construction sector, which consumes 60 percent of the steel produced in the country, is showing sign of improvement.

That is the nature of this stock as well. So, look at it from a trading perspective, and then keep on being more punctual with your trading approach, that would be a better approach at this point of time because the longer term charts, they take at least six months or eight months to really show signs of bottoming out because the longer term trend since we have seen in the last one and half year, most of these metal names is still bearish to say so.\" \"I believe that the approach should be that you try and book out profits from your trading positions. At least do partial profits at levels of Rs 120-125 where there seems to be a good amount of resistance for Vedanta. That seems to be a good zone where you can take out profits. Look for further corrections, if it comes down to below Rs 100 again, then you could look to add it back from a trading portfolio per se.

'Go long in Just Dial\r\nadvises going long in Just Dial and Adani Port.\r\nThe market is extremely stock specific right now and the situation will be slightly muddy if I may say so becuase of the rollovers which will happen. So it will be a difficult read whether the up or down movements that you are witnessing are directional in nature and they are being caused by transient rollover action. So given that I would suggest that one should be a little hesitant to trade aggressively today especially considering that the market has not moved up from the start and have a mix of both longs and shorts just to be on the safe side.\" \"In terms of best play, fairly decent rally seems to have set off in Just Dial   . That has began from somewhere on Friday and seems to be carrying on. So if you have Just Dial pulling back a little, it is currently at about Rs 880 for the November series. So if you have a pullback to somewhere around Rs 875 thereabouts, I would venture a long position in Just Dial just as a kind of a short covering rally not that this is in a bull phase, it is very clearly down,\" he added. \"Second stock which could be tried on the long side would be Adani Ports   , which is showing fairly decent upside breakout from a sideways movement and doing so, with some volumes and momentum.
