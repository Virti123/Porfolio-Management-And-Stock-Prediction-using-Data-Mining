#  Porfolio-Management-Stock-Prediction-and-Recommendation-using-Data-Mining

There are several factors which affect the price of a stock. Some of them are daily news articles, volume of that stock traded, sentiment in the market, profit of the company etc. Due to the advancement in technology a large amount of data about the stocks is generated every day in the form of news articles, analyst reviews, twitter data etc. The increasing amount of data is making it increasingly difficult to manually analyse the data to make strategic decisions.  We implemented and compared the results of three classification algorithms (1) Na√Øve Bayes (2) Random Forest.
